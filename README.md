# DH 150 Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation of NFL Fantasy Football Mobile App by Josh Mimura

## Introduction

Every Sunday from September to January, millions of Americans tune into the NFL (National Football League) weekly games to cheer on their favorite teams. Many members of this sports community are involved in a league of their own - fantasy football. Fantasy football is a game in which enthusiastic fans draft and develop real world NFL players to create a virtual football team that competes with other fantasy teams in the fantasy football community. 

I chose to evaluate the NFL Fantasy Football App because it houses a community that brings me joy and excitement every week. I am a huge sports fan with a special love for football, and fantasy football allows me to exercise and express my knowledge and love for the NFL. I am interested in how the app’s design enhances or hinders its usability for the average user like me, who doesn’t usually analyze the app from a designer’s perspective. Given that Fantasy Football is enormously popular, every element of its design must be extremely strategic, however subtle it may be. I also want to learn how the usability design of the platform fosters a sense of community and connection with other fantasy football enthusiasts. Hopefully, my UX design will contribute to the football fan community by enhancing the usability of the NFL Fantasy Football App and by adding new features that strengthen the social ties between its members. 


## Description

The NFL Fantasy Football App is a mobile application platform for virtual football competition between users. At the beginning of the NFL season in September, users create a league with their friends and family, and create a team by drafting real-world football players. The goal is to create a team that produces good results in the real world, as the outcome of the fantasy football competition is determined by how well a user's players do from week to week. The NFL regular season is 16 weeks long. Each week, users in the fantasy football league match up against other users in the league. At the end of the season, the user with the most wins claims victory, or in some leagues, the top four users enter an elimination playoff.
