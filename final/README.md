## UCLA Bruins App UX Project by Joshua Mimura

## Introduction

My DH 150 project analyzes and improves upon several design features of the UCLA Bruins Sports App. I chose to evaluate the UCLA Bruin mobile app because it cultivates and empowers members of the UCLA sports community. For sports enthusiasts like me, the UCLA Bruin app allows users to access sports scores, buy tickets, and watch highlights. The goal of this project is to understand how the design of the UCLA Bruins app helps or hinders the apps usability and how it can be modified to increase interaction within the sports community. The project consists of several methods of evaluation from task-based testing to contextual inquiries. This project will contribute to the UCLA sports community by adding features to the UCLA Bruins App that are more efficient, accessible, and allow for interaction between sports fans. 

## Design Statement

After a series of evaluation and testing, I determined that the UCLA Bruins app lacks in two main areas. First, the UCLA Bruins app needs to be simpler and more easily accessible. These attributes are extremely important to sports app users, who are usually busy and don't have time to surf the web for their sports news. Second, the UCLA Bruins app can do a better job of connecting users within the sports community. The sports community has lost some of its cohesion with the rise of technology, but if digital platforms like the UCLA Bruins app can incorporate features that spark interaction between users, the social cohesion of this community can be restored. 

## Competitor Analysis and Heuristic Evaluation

I first conducted a heuristic evaluation of the UCLA Bruins App to analyze its initial design. Among other things, I found that the app had several inefficient interfaces with extraneous information. I also found that navigation was difficult because the app featured two menus, one at the bottom and a sidebar menu. Most notably, I noticed that there was no feature on the app that allows sports app users to interact with each other. The UCLA Bruins app had some strengths though, such as allowing users to personalize their experience by subscribing to specific sports. Feel free to read more about my heuristic evaluation [Here.](https://github.com/joshmimura/DH-150-Assignments/tree/master/assignment01) You can download the app [Here.](https://uclabruins.com/sports/2014/8/22/209612683.aspx)

Part of my initial valuation of the app involved comparing it to other sports apps. The two main competitors to the UCLA Bruins app are the ESPN sports app and The Score app. These apps provide sports news on worldwide sports, whereas the UCLA Bruins app only covers UCLA sports. Nevertheless, these two competitors serve as good reference points when evaluating the UCLA Bruins app. They featured more efficient and intuitive interfaces which informed some of my design choices in my final prototype.

After my personal evaluations, I conducted user testing on the UCLA Bruins app to understand the extent to which the app's design facilitates or hinders a user's ability to complete routine tasks. I tasked the user with three of the app's basic functions including checking past scores, purchasing tickets to an upcoming event, and subscribing to their favorite sport. I learned that many design elements of the UCLA Bruins app made its use cumbersome and frustrating for the user. While the participant was able to complete each task, she expressed difficulty in doing so. I used the user testing results to inform which aspects of the UCLA Bruins app I would improve on. You can read more about the usability testing process [Here](https://github.com/joshmimura/DH-150-Assignments/tree/master/assignment02).

## 5) Contextual Inquiry

After usability testing, I engaged in broader contextual research on sports apps and sports app users. The goal of this contextual inquiry was to explore the environmental, social, and physical context in which users of mobile sports apps operate, which would give me insight into how mobile sports apps, such as the UCLA Bruins Mobile App, can be better designed to restore the strength of the sports community. From my contextual inquiry, I learned that sports app users prioritize efficiency and accessibility above all else. They want an app that serves as a quick referencing tool for sports news. I also learned that sports app users tend to interact with other sports fans through other apps like Twitter and Facebook, rather than sports apps themselves.

## 6) UX storytelling: Personas, Journey Maps, Scenarios

Based on my understanding of sports app users, I developed three personas and scenarios that depicted the archetypal users of the UCLA Bruins app and their typical interactions with the app. Brad represented the busy user who only used the app to check scores during his packed schedule. His primary challenge was overcoming accessibility and efficiency issues in the initial app design. Corbin had more time to spend on the app and would benefit from a new team profile interface feature. Velma's experience on the UCLA Bruins app was quite isolated, as there was no way to share sports content with her friends. However, with a shareability feature, Velma is now able to interact with other members of the sports community through the app. For detailed persona profiles, click [Here.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BkhKiJj7zESs3z-lOGtVp3-dHYXIVyu4CPF9qK0farA) For written scenarios, click [Here.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Lj-iBppATrlB1HhEf304bsG7kUPglmZXOQABD4-dDQs)

## Wireframe and Graphic Design Accessibility 

Before beginning prototype development, I played around with possible color schemes that maximized color contrast accessibility. Specifically, I was concerned with creating color schemes that featured contrast ratios higher than 4.5:1. I proceeded to develop 3 sample interfaces that met accessibility requirements. Click [Here](https://joshmimura.github.io/DH-150-Assignments/assignment07/color-JOSHMIMURA.html) to view my samples. 

I soon began on initial wireframes for my low-fidelity prototype. I first started by designing four main menu screens and the new team profile interface. These wireframes were not detailed, but they provided me with a consistent interface structure for the rest of my low-fidelity prototype.

## Low-fidelity Prototyping

Starting with my initial set of wireframes, I created a wireflow interaction for each of the three features I had decided to incorporate into the app: 1) a more efficient score interface, 2) a team profile interface, and 3) a shareability feature.

After developing the initial prototype, I conducted a user pathway test. In this test, the participant tried to follow the flow of my low-fidelity prototype. The goal of this phase was to understand the strengths and weaknesses in the initial interface pathway and how it could be improved. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hu164L5sLFb_K0M_hLI1YcOh7gIdVY8T/view?usp=sharing) is a link to the user pathway test. Below are the marked-up interaction sequences after the user pathway test.

Next, I used the comments and critiques generated in the user pathway test to refine the low-fidelity prototype. For instance, the participant was unable to return to the home page in one of my wireflows, so I added a cancel button. Below is the low-fidelity prototype with my revisions.

## High-fidelity Prototyping 

Now that I had developed a better sense of the interaction flow of my prototype, I turned my attention to the high-fidelity aspects of my design. Through Figma, I refined and brought my low-fidelity interface to life by adding color, interaction features, dynamic elements, and other graphical interface components. I was sure to make the interaction flow completely circular with no dead ends and paid particular attention to making navigation simple and intuitive. Below are the four main high-fidelity menu interfaces.

The high-fidelity prototype supports several tasks: 

1. Check scores
- check today's UCLA scores
- check tomorrow's UCLA scores
- view the game summary of an ongoing game
- view the game summary of a past game
- view the game summary of a future game

2. Share audio or video content
- browse video and audio media content
- pause/play audio content
- send media content to other mobile users via SMS text message

3. Access team profile interface
- view team profiles of UCLA football
- access NOW, ROSTER, and SCHEDULE subinterfaces of UCLA football
- view past performances, player statistics, and current rankings

## Prototype Revision Analysis

Throughout the prototyping process, I cycled through several versions of each interface. (See above for the multiple versions of the low-fidelity prototype.) Below are the two main versions of the high-fidelity prototype. After receiving comments and suggestions from my peers and professor, I made several changes to my initial high-fidelity prototype regarding its color scheme, heading format, edge radius, and thumbnails. You can read more about these particular adjustments [Here.](https://github.com/joshmimura/DH-150-Assignments/tree/master/assignment08).

## 11) Conclusion

I learned several things during my DH 150 project on the UCLA Bruins app:

User-based Evidence: I learned that understanding user experience means trying to position yourself as best you can inside the users mind rather than speculating as to what users prefer. It is easy to project your opinions and understanding of design  onto users, but the designer is always biased. The only way to make constructive design choices is to actually produce data based on a user's behavior (through user testing, field research, pathway testing, etc.) and to use this data to better understand the user's experience. 

Graphical Interface Accessibility: I learned that graphical interface choices are very scientific and technical. I previously did not know anything about color schemes or geometric nudging, but this project has taught me that everything on the interface must be deliberate and must meet certain accessibility standards. I now know that colors that have a text-background relationship must have a contrast ratio greater than 4.5:1 for them to be distinguished clearly for all users. 

Tradeoffs: UX design is all about tradeoffs. In choosing whether or not to include certain information into my designs, I was constantly faced with dilemmas: do I add more information and make the interface slightly more cluttered, or do I retain the minimalist look at the expense of the interfaces informativeness? In the end, it was about finding the right balance in every decision I made. Thus, I learned that you cannot have everything, and the tradeoffs you make will largely depend on the function of certain elements and the purpose of your app (e.g. I prioritized information over minimalism on the team profile interface because this interface is meant to inform the user on a team's season performance.)

Don't Use Pen: Prototyping and wireframe development is full of mistakes, redos, and tinkering. They involve a large amount of time crossing things out and modifying small things about the interface. I learned that these processes just take time and can be quite tedious, so the designer needs to become comfortable with never feeling 100% content with any given prototype. In sum, don't use a pen because the final product is never really final. 

Importance of Internal Consistency: When developing the high-fidelity prototype, I realized that many of my design elements were not consistent. For example, some rectangles had a 90-degree edge radius while others had smooth edges. I noted that this inconsistency made my interfaces seem clunky and unprofessional. Thus, I learned that internal consistency can go a long way in increasing the legitimacy of you prototype.
