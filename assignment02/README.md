# Pilot Usability Test 

## Introduction 

The UCLA Bruin mobile app is a digital platform that provides information and functions related to UCLA sports. The user can check box scores, watch highlights, buy tickets, and assess team performances. The app allows the user to personalize his/her experience by "subscribing" to specific sports. In doing so, the user can receive more detailed and frequent updates about his/her sport of interest. The app also provides free live radio and on demand content that covers UCLA sports.

After conducting a heuristic evaluation on the UCLA Bruin mobile app, several usability concerns emerged. First, the design structure of the app does a poor job of matching its system to real world concepts. Second, the internal and external consistency is lacking, making it difficult for users to efficiently navigate the app. Third, the app does not take advantage of recognition-based search design; rather, it relies on the user to memorize specific dates, times, and players. Fourth, the app's functions are not very flexible as there are few features that allow expert users to efficiently personalize their experience on the app. Fifth, the app's error processing system is weak. It fails to notify the user when a system error occurs, let alone offer advice on how to move forward. Finally, and most notably, the aesthetic design of the app is cluttered and unpleasant.  

Given these concerns, I will conduct a usability test to understand the extent to which the app's design facilitates or hinders a user's ability to complete routine tasks. Task 1 will ask the user to check past basketball game scores and future event dates. Here, I will try to understand how the user interacts with the inconsistencies and inflexibilities in the scheduling interface. This task will also give insight into how much recall this ordinary task demands from the user. Task 2 will test the user's ability to efficiently purchase tickets for an upcoming sports event. This task will illuminate the degree to which the cluttered interfaces and weak error processing systems will affect the user's ability to buy tickets, a central function of the UCLA Bruins app. Lastly, Task 3 asks the user to personalize his/her experience on the app by subscribing to a particular sport and modifying its notification settings. In doing so, I hope to gain insight into how the flexibility and user freedom of the app can be improved. The ultimate goal of this test is to **understand** and **improve** the usability experience from the **user's perspective**. 

## Methodology

The pilot usability test will be conducted in a quiet office room. The moderator and the participant will sit adjacent to each other. A computer will record the participant's reactions throughout the test and will display a survey that the moderator will use to guide the participant. The participant will use my phone, which will be screen recorded through the computer. This is a pilot trial and is meant to test the setting, materials, and software in order to improve the usability testing process. 

The moderator will first introduce the usability test process to the participant. After giving informed consent, the participant will fill out a pre-test questionnaire which measures first impressions of the UCLA Bruins app's interfaces. Then, the participant will complete each of the three tasks, articulating his/her thoughts as she progresses. After completing these tests, the participant will fill answer post-test questions about his/her experience during the trial. This questionnaire will measure the participant's opinions on the app's ease of use, efficiency of use, expected frequency of use, learnability, aesthetics, and content organization. In addition, the participant will choose five words that most characterize his/her experience during the trial, providing a more holistic understanding of the participant's attitudes toward the app. Finally, the participant will provide demographic information which will remain confidential. 

our introduction will have the name of web/app you test and what is that web/app about. 
Report the rationale behind of UT with the list of the usability issues you found from your heuristic reviews
Indicate that the purpose of the usability testing aims to find out how to improve the web/app from userâ€™s perspective.

Describe the setting(where, portable minimalistic lab), equipment(computer, software)
Report that it is a pilot test (in order to test the setting and the materials).
Describe the process (ex. Background questions, pretest, posttest) and what was measured (ex. Ease of use)

## Reflection 

Write a short paragraph about:
what you learned during the pilot test, 
what went well and what went not so well 
how you want to improve your UT in the future
