## Project Summary

This project examines the role the UCLA Bruin's app plays in strengthening cohesion within the sports community by providing mobile access to sports news, scores, and highlights. The project also attempts to understand the design deficiencies of the app and how it can be improved. 

Through contextual user research, I have learned several things about how members of the sports community might use news apps like the UCLA Bruins app and what design areas can be improved based on this. First, efficiency is extremely important to sports app users. They express their desire to be able to quickly check a score on the sports app, without having to go online and manually look up an ongoing game. Second, people in the sports community often talk with their friends about sports in person but have less opportunities to do so outside of face-to-face interactions. The current UCLA Bruins app does not capitalize on this opportunity since it does not have an accessible sharing feature that allows for more online interaction in the sports community. Finally, I observed that users of sports apps are more likely to be deeply interested in sports, can recognize sports jargon, and appreciate skeuomorphic design elements that mirror familiar sports concepts, such as a box score presented in a real-life score table format.

Based on this contextual research as well as other methods of design evaluation, I modeled three personas that would be able to achieve their sports related goals with my design concepts. Like many sports app users, the day is busy and there is little time to spend looking for sports news. The busy user who needs quick access to scores is embodied through Brad. Other users, like Corbin, like to analyze ongoing sports leagues in more detail and would benefit from a team profile interface. Velma represents people in the sports community that wish to be more involved and feel that digital technology has increased information accessibility but has decreased the social interaction between fans. She would appreciate a feature that would allow her to share sports media with friends through a mobile device.

Given these personas and their needs, I have developed a low-fidelity prototype that outlines three improved/new features of the UCLA Bruins app. These features include (1) a revamped "score" interface, (2) an informative "team profile" interface, and (3) a sharing feature that allows users to send media content to others through several digital mediums. Each feature would improve the user experience of Brad, Corbin, and Velma, respectively. The following wireframes and wireflows illustrate the sequential process by which a user would use these new features. 

The purpose of the low-fidelity prototyping process is to lay out how exactly the user will be interacting with the UCLA Bruins mobile app. Specifically, I want to understand how I can incorporate my three features into the app's logical sequence of interfaces in a functional and user-based way. I do this by sketching low-fidelity wireframes and use them to create wireflow sequences. Then, I will have another user navigate through my wireflows to help me understand what works and what needs improvement in my current design. Using this information, I can refine and improve my low-fidelity prototype.

## Content Reflection and Potential Design Improvements

Task #1: Sharing Media

For the most part, the user pathway testing for task #1 went smoothly. The user was able to progress through the wireframes with good knowledge on how to get from one to the other. However, the user missed other cancel features and back track features that were not obvious or absent. For instance, the user did not notice the "cancel" button in the "new message" wireframe (bottom middle), and I had to direct her attention to it. I also noticed that there was no way for the user to back out of the 5th wireframe (bottom right corner) because there was no cancel option. Therefore, I think I should make cancel and back track options more prominent so the user can find them. For instance, I should make the "cancel" button 2.5D in order to catch the user's eye, and I should add a cancel option in the 5th wireframe so that the user can cancel the sharing option at any time. 

Task #2: Team Profile

Task #2 went well, but the user slightly misinterpreted the interface structure. The user thought that the "Now", "Roster", and "Schedule" wireframes were independent interfaces. As a result, when I asked her if she could return to the main menu, she figured she needed to keep pressing the back button three times to do so, when she only needed to twice. The actual structure of the interface is static, with a fluid sub-interfaces labeled "Now", "Roster", and "Schedule". The user is supposed to swipe between these sub-interfaces rather than be presented with a new interface for each. I do not think I need to change anything about the design, since the user's misinterpretation was more due to the limited interactivity of my paper prototype rather than a design flaw. Nevertheless, I can perhaps integrate a tutorial function that shows the user how to navigate the team profile sub-interfaces.

Task #3: Checking Scores

In task #3, the user was unclear on which part of the score interface to click on in order to progress to the individual event interfaces. She assumed that she would just tap on the entire box for each game, but I noted that there was no indicator for where to tap. In order to fix this issue, I should add right-pointing arrow symbols in each game box to indicate to the user where he/she needs to tap to proceed to a more detailed matchup interface. This will prevent the user from randomly guessing  where to tap on the screen. In addition, I noticed that if the user wanted to tap on a matchup profile for a future game, there was no wireframe that displayed what the new interface would look like. As such, I created a new wireframe (bottom right corner) to show the interface for future matchups as opposed to ongoing matchups.

## Summary of Process and Reflection

Overall, I think the process went smoothly. Though it took a long time to brainstorm my five basic wireframes, I think they turned out simple and functional. I was able to use these wireframes as my starting points for my wireflow prototypes and mirror the same style across any new wireframes I added. Doing so kept my interfaces consistent and easy for the user to navigate.

I did, however, make some mistakes along the way. First, I was drawing too many arrows and flow guidelines in my initial prototypes without realizing that these indicators would give the answers to the user pathway test. I had to erase any pathway indicators beyond the basic arrows so that the user would not have any extra help. I also learned that using a pencil is very important, since I often needed to redraw something or slightly alter a wireframe. I actually started the wireframes in pen and quickly realized that this would be extremely inefficient and messy. In addition, I realized that it is really easy to forget to integrate cancel and back track options when drafting up a low-fidelity prototype. My mind was so occupied with how the user would progress through the steps, that I sometimes forgot to think about how the user would back track through each interface. It is also important to think about which parts of the screen can be scrolled up and down upon and which ones cannot when drafting low-fidelity prototypes. I had to keep this in mind when choosing where to place the scroll bar on the side of the screen. In some interfaces, I put it just below the header, indicating that everything on the page besides the header would scroll. On other interfaces, I put the scroll bar further down the screen, which is meant to emphasize that only the lower subsection of the screen is scrollable.

The user pathway test itself went well, though I wish I had invested more time in setting up a better recording system. In this test, I just tilted my laptop screen downwards on the desk to show the users interactions with the paper prototype. Next time, I should probably find a way to position the camera above the user so that the prototypes are seen from the POV of the user rather than from the side.
