# DH 150 Assignment 01: 
# Heuristic Evaluation of the NFL Fantasy Football Mobile App by Josh Mimura

***

## Introduction

Every Sunday from September to January, millions of Americans tune into the NFL (National Football League) weekly games to cheer on their favorite teams. Many members of this sports community are involved in a league of their own - fantasy football. Fantasy football is a game in which enthusiastic fans draft and develop real world NFL players to create a virtual football team that competes with other fantasy teams in the fantasy football community. 

I chose to evaluate the NFL Fantasy Football App because it houses a community that brings me joy and excitement every week. I am a huge sports fan with a special love for football, and fantasy football allows me to exercise and express my knowledge of and enthusiasm for the sport. I am interested in how the app’s design enhances or hinders its usability for the average user like me, who doesn’t usually analyze the app from a designer’s perspective. Given that Fantasy Football is enormously popular, every element of its design must be extremely strategic, however subtle it may be. I also want to learn how the usability design of the platform fosters a sense of community and connection with other fantasy football players. Hopefully, my UX design will contribute to the football fan community by enhancing the usability of the NFL Fantasy Football App and by adding new features that strengthen the social ties between its members. 

## Description

The NFL Fantasy Football App is a mobile application platform for virtual football competition between users. At the beginning of the NFL season in September, users create a league with their friends and family, and create a team by drafting real-world football players. The goal is to create a team that produces good results in the real world, as the outcome of the fantasy football competition is determined by how well a user's players do from week to week. The NFL regular season is 16 weeks long. Each week, users in the fantasy football league match up against other users in the league. At the end of the season, the user with the most wins claims victory, or in some leagues, the top four users enter an elimination playoff. 

The App has many other features that allow the user to analyze a player's past and future performance in order to construct a higher scoring team. Users have access to live in-game highlights and notable NFL news about injuries and trades. For more information on how Fantasy Football works, see here. [http://www.nfl.com/fantasyfootball/story/0ap3000000692955/article/how-to-play-fantasy-football-a-beginners-guide](http://www.nfl.com/fantasyfootball/story/0ap3000000692955/article/how-to-play-fantasy-football-a-beginners-guide)  

NFL Fantasy Football can be downloaded as a mobile app or used on a web browser. This link will allow you to download the app, but it can also be downloaded on the Apple App Store. [http://www.nfl.com/mobile/fantasy](http://www.nfl.com/mobile/fantasy). This is the link to the browser version of Fantasy Football, but I evaluate only the mobile version.

## Overall Evaluation

In one sentence, the NFL Fantasy Football App gets the job done. That is, it is a functional tool that I use to manage my fantasy team, analyze player performances, and monitor my weekly matchups. The structural design of the app is simple, and navigation is easy. For users like me who have played fantasy for a long time, the app is quickly learned and immediately functional. I can search for players easily, request a trade with another user, and optimize my weekly lineups with a few taps of the screen. I can also conduct more detailed statistical analysis because the app provides data on every player's past, present, and future (projected) performance. The app is extremely flexible for both beginner users and expert users and uses conventional football language. Thanks to the constant warning messages and expert advice, I avoid making errors that could hurt my fantasy team. 

I think the usability of this app can be improved most by redesigning the boring roster/statistical interfaces to be more skeuomorphic. As of now, the team management interface is functional, but not structurally intuitive. It simply lists players from top to bottom - a boring and tedious way to display a user's fantasy team. In addition, the fantasy football experience can be improved by expediting player evaluation process. For instance, instead of having to look at multiple statistics to judge a player's worth, a user should be able to evaluate player's more quickly using just one or two composite indicators. Finally, fantasy football is all about competition. The addition of more interactive functions like built-in wagers, more exciting trash talk chats, and shareable highlight clips should strengthen the social aspect of the user experience.  

## 1: Visibility of System Status

The NFL Fantasy football app does a good job of keeping the user informed on the system status at any given time. Whenever a page is loading or buffering, the universal circular loading sign appears on the center of the screen. Should the connection be poor, a "something went wrong" message accompanied by an exclamation point icon appears on the screen. In addition, the scroll bar on the right side of the screen tells the user where he/she is relative to the bottom of the page. 

When a user is scrolling through league matchups during a certain week, a horizontal line of blue buttons indicates which matchup the user is looking at. That is, if there are 5 matchups in the league, there are five buttons at the bottom that tells the user which matchup is currently on the interface. If a user wants to edit his/her lineup, the up and down arrows next to each player's name lets the user know that the app is currently in edit mode. 

Overall, the visibility of system status is strong on the NFL Fantasy Football App.

Severity Rating: 1

## 2: Match Between System and the Real World

While the lack of skeuomorphic design does not threaten the basic functionality of the app, the NFL Fantasy Football App can improve its design by matching its system with real world concepts more often. For example, the roster interface of the app is structured as a list. A user's 10 player team is simply listed from top to bottom, with the player position to the left of the player face. However, this design is not as intuitive as, say, if the roster interface took the form of a football formation. Football fans are familiar with football formations and seeing a roster in a real-life football formation is more intuitive than seeing a roster in a top-to-bottom list. 

Current Roster Interface:
![FF Interfaces](https://i0.wp.com/zacharylalich.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Team_Roster_375-5.png)

More Skeuomorphic Roster Interface:

![FF Interfaces](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/madden-nfl-20/8/88/Madden20-mut-06.jpg?width=1280)

The NFL Fantasy Football App excels in its use of conventional language. Using words and abbreviations that members of the sports community are familiar with like "roster", "QB", "TD", etc., the app's diction connects its systems well to the real world. For example, if a user were to trade a player to another user's team, the app coding would engage in something the average user would not be familiar with. However, the app simply calls this a "trade", something that makes sense to the average football fan. 

In sum, the NFL Fantasy Football App can do a better job of matching its system with the real world, but it's lack of intuitive design structure in certain interfaces does not substantially hinder the user's experience.

Severity Rating: 2

## 3: User Control and Freedom

The NFL Fantasy Football App's strongest area of design is in the amount of user control and freedom users have when using it. More generally, the user can always back out of player profiles by tapping the X in the top right hand corner of the screen. On other interfaces, users can tap the back arrow located in the top left hand of the screen to return to the previous menu. The five menu tabs at the bottom of the screen allow for quick navigation to different interfaces. This allows the user to travel from one page to a completely different page with one tap, as opposed to having to navigate back out to a master directory and back in to the desired page. 

![FF Interfaces](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=19XddaN7Sz-7g_FzbXUx0TJI6PgdSL7Xp)

The app excels in offering user control in the player search interface. The user can filter the player search by position, availability of player, season year, projected scores, trends, and present stats. Each player profile provides the players rank, average # of points, % owned, and bye week (the week the player does not play). In addition, the profile provides data on the points scored week to week throughout the season as well as projected points for the rest of the year. These statistical features are critical in Fantasy Football since the goal of the game is to pick the best performing players. As such, user control and freedom is what I appreciate most about the NFL Fantasy Football App's user experience.

Severity Rating: 1

## 4: Consistency and Standards

Internal Consistency: The NFL Fantasy Football App is, for the most part, internally consistent. User profiles always appear as circular pictures with the user's league rank to the upper left hand side of the profile. The user name lies below his/her profile picture with the user's league record to the right. NFL player profiles are also consistent, with their names bolded above their team, position, and number. Some errors with consistency occur when a user wants to back out of certain interfaces. In the player profile interface, the user must tap the "x" in the upper right corner to escape, whereas in the "edit team" screen, the escape button is an arrow in the top left corner. Beyond this minor inconsistency, the app is easy to navigate due to its good internal consistency.

![FF Interfaces](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1irer3q8SDaToTXyIxNs3bXcIkTFSKr2N)


External Consistency: The NFL Fantasy Football App is not the only fantasy football app. ESPN and Yahoo also have their own mobile apps. The NFL app is again, for the most part, externally consistent. The roster interface is very similar to ESPN and Yahoo's roster interfaces as all three apps use a list structure to depict the user's roster. In addition, the matchup interface between Yahoo and NFL almost identical. Each of the user's players are located to the left and right of each other, with their current score in bolded black. The aggregate score of each user's team is located at the top of the page. The external consistency of the NFL Fantasy Football App makes the app's usability easier for users who are familiar with other fantasy football formats.

Severity Rating: 1

## 5: Error Prevention

For many people, the weekend fantasy football league is a big deal and accidentally dropping or trading away a player could be devastating for a user's team. Fortunately, the NFL Fantasy Football App is designed well to prevent errors. If a user wants to drop a player, the user must confirm the decision when the app asks, "Are you sure?". Similarly, when adding a player to a lineup, the user must "confirm add" and drop any players that exceed the roster limit. In addition, the app notifies the user of injured or inactive players on the starting roster with colored icons next to a players name. If a player is out, a yellow "O" sits next to his name, allowing the user to swap out the inactive player for an active one. Injury notifications are a crucial part of error prevention and have saved me multiple times from accidentally playing an inactive player. Another more subtle method of error prevention is by providing score projections for each player. This allows the user to make the best decision on which players to play that week. If a player is projected to score very low, it might be a good idea to put them in the reserves. In sum, the app's design and features do a great job of preventing costly user errors. 


![FF prevention](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1FbhoXngM_jgGO1RR_v_XY3ZjkSDSM_tJ)

![FF prevention](https://m.fantasy.nfl.com/_next/static/images/edit-2019-6e58f120240b87b6fab2ab46f9e3e2d5.png)

The small gray numbers to the right side of each player is a projected score for that week. This error prevention method helps the user avoid playing E.Ebron this week, who is predicted to score fewer points than T.Kelce. 

Severity Rating: 1

## 6: Recognition rather than Recall

The NFL Fantasy Football App does not require much recall from the user at all. The primary instance in which a user needs to remember something is when the user is looking for a specific player in the app database. The app provides an effective search system that does not require the user to recall the specific name of the player. Rather, the user only has to know what position of the desired player. If the user knows that the desired player is a quarterback, then the user can filter search results for just quarterbacks. The search engine generates a list of players names that are supplemented with logos of the teams they are on and a portrait picture of each player. In addition, at the top of the player search interface is a "Most Added Players" section which offers the user a quick way to add a desired player based on the popularity of the player they are looking for. As such, the user rarely needs to recall specific details about a player to find them. All the user needs to know is what the player's position, what team they play for, or what the player looks like. Overall, the nature of fantasy football does not demand that the user have a good memory, but in situations in which the user must remember something, the app reduces the need to recall with a search system that emphasizes recognition. 

![FF recog](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1XXpRQLVNhaZekCWdM-oSwSKgbDHLt3Yt)

Severity Rating: 1

## 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

The NFL Fantasy Football App offers a limited number of features that make the user experience enjoyable and efficient for both expert level users and beginners. For example, when drafting players at the beginning of the season, expert users can analyze the player pool and set their pre-draft order. During the draft, they can assign players to their queue to be auto-drafted during the next round. For beginners, the draft can be intimidating, so the app allows users to complete the draft based on pre-determined rankings by experts. That is, beginners who do not know how to draft can auto-draft their entire team without needing to go through the more complicated process of expert users. 

Another feature that increases the user's efficiency is the optimization function. This function allows the user to auto-generate the best projected roster for a given week without needing to manually switch players in and out of the lineup. Players who want more control over their team are still able to change their roster manually and do not have to optimize their roster based on the app's projected scores. 

![FF flexibility](http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/fantasy/general/fan_images_league-types.png)

I believe the app can improve when it comes to flexibility and efficiency of use. Expert users should be able to auto-add potential free agents without needing to monitor their availability status throughout the season. For instance, if I want Mark Ingram on my team, I should be able to tap a function that notifies me of his availability and automatically adds him to my team when possible. Another possible improvement that would make the fantasy football experience easier for beginners is to develop an aggregate rating measure for each player. This single rating will take into account multiple other predictors of success and can serve as a simple guide for beginners who are trying to decide who to put on their team. This experience contrasts the current experience in which users need to tediously analyze players using many statistics such as play time, style of offense, and past performance.

Severity Rating: 2

## 8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

Using a white, turquoise, and gray color palette, the NFL Fantasy Football App provides the user with a aesthetically acceptable interface. Headings and sections are rectangular with smooth corners and are all in readable font. Colors do not clash, and even small text is readable. Player profiles feature light logo backgrounds that do not interfere with the player pictures and add flavor to the interface. 

The design is also quite minimalist, given the amount of information a user needs to be successful in fantasy football. The roster interface provides a picture, name, and total points of each player with details about the team they play for and their position. The top of the interface shows the user's league record and any win or loss streak he/she might be on. There are options to trade, manage waivers, or add players. The information given on the roster interface is necessary and informative. Some elements such as the player picture may be unnecessary, but without them, the interface lacks spirit. 

![FF prevention](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1UC1ltYuF_ddHJvOLedElpBsmvqXlI8B2)

The player profile is also minimalist in design. Each player has five summary statistics at the top with information about the latest matchup below. Clicking the "stats" tab allows the user to see more in-depth data about that player and his past performances. There are no unnecessary graphics or text. 

![FF prevention](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HNOTmuHg26RqYUyOqtrJHFlLYew_KXb3)

Overall, the NFL Fantasy Football App is aesthetically acceptable and not too cluttered with information. There may be some room to improve upon the app in this regard such as changing to a richer color palette or reducing the amount of numbers on certain interfaces, but the current state of the app's aesthetics does not undermine the user experience to any noticeable extent. 

Severity Rating: 1

## 9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

The NFL Fantasy Football App does a poor job of notifying, diagnosing, and recovering from system errors. The most common error I ran into when testing was a connection error. Lacking internet service, the app prompts the user with a "Something went wrong" message. This tells the user that there is an error but does not describe what the error is or how to fix it. This hurts the user experience because this vague message leaves the user uninformed and unable to fix the issue. 

![FF prevention](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1J8h8P4CnwU6nymX5eGZJsCSJ8Pslb-tO)

I was unable to trigger other error processing notifications during my testing, but based on what I observed, I believe the app has much room for improvement in this area. For instance, the app should identify what the problem is and suggest concrete steps to fix it. If it is a connection or loading error, it is better that the user knows, so that he/she can try to fix it. 

Severity Rating: 2

## 10: Help and Documentation

The NFL Fantasy Football App excels when it comes to help and documentation. The app provides basic documents like the terms and conditions and the privacy policy. Notably, there is a search system in the settings tab that allows users to ask questions and look up key words. For instance, if a user wants to learn how to add and drop players, he/she can turn to this search system for advice on how to do this (see below). In addition, the home page interface provides articles that help users with fantasy football strategies and predictions. Every week, for example, NFL.com publishes recommendations on which players should start and which players should stay in reserves. Overall, the NFL Fantasy Football App provides an abundance of resources for users who have questions about the functionality of the app itself and for users who want to effectively compete in their fantasy football league.

![FF prevention](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1IrrpO_nfWcbFzkQL3fDK4M8Nlmhd9fgj)

![FF prevention](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1sudZ_R67X6RePhH2YxcTkqTKD9aucrJx)

One weak point of the mobile app is that it is does not provide introductory materials for completely new users. Users who have no experience with fantasy football will find themselves lost as they are thrown into an interface built for users who already know how fantasy football works. The app could drastically improve its user experience and marketing if it offered a tutorial system or fantasy beginner's guide. 

Severity Rating: 2

# Heuristic Evaluation of Spotify's Mobile App by Josh Mimura

***

## Introduction

The explosion of subscription-based music media platforms in the last decade have created a new community of listeners that can enjoy, share, and personalize their preferred music experiences. This community is unique because peer to peer interactions are rarely direct; rather, social connections exist through a mutual interest in an artist or genre of music. 

I chose to evaluate Spotify because it is an app that millions of people in the listening community use every day. I am interested in how the app’s design enhances or hinders its usability for the average user like me, who doesn’t usually analyze the app from a designer’s perspective. Given that Spotify is enormously popular, every element of its design must be extremely strategic, however subtle it may be.  In addition, I am interested in how the usability design of the platform fosters a sense of community and connection with other listeners. My UX design will contribute to the music community by enhancing the usability of Spotify and by adding new features that strengthen social ties between its members. 

## Description

Spotify is a media service platform that allows users to stream and download music, podcasts, and other forms of audio media. Users can access Spotify through a mobile app, which allows them to personalize, organize, and share music and other media. The app has several interfaces that allow direct song control as well as navigation through one's music collection. 

Spotify can be downloaded as a mobile app or used on a web browser. Here, I evaluate the usability of the application. This link will allow you to download Spotify, but it can also be downloaded on the Apple App Store. [https://www.spotify.com/us/connect/](https://www.spotify.com/us/connect/)

## Overall Evaluation

There is a reason Spotify has 217 million regular users worldwide. Its design elements work together in making the app an efficient, aesthetic, and empowering music listening platform for all types of users. Spotify excels in keeping the user informed on the system status, lending the user much freedom and control, and remaining internally and externally consistent. The intuitive design of the app emulates real world physics, and the range of functions enhances both the beginner and expert user's experience. Spotify's app can improve most by expanding help systems for users who run into technical troubles. Instead of suggesting vague solutions to errors, the app should take the user step by step through the problem-solving process. In addition, more open-ended help outlets should be provided, such as a live chat box or FAQ section. An area of great potential is to enhance song search systems on the app by turning limited aural and lyrical recall into concrete search results. Other areas of improvement include enhancing error prevention. Often, users will accidentally skip a song or delete one from their playlist. Spotify does not have any mechanisms to prevent these small errors, which can annoy users. Fortunately, these minor issues do not threaten the overall functionality of the app. Spotify makes its user experience enjoyable, flexible, and efficient. 


## 1: Visibility of System Status

Spotify does a good job of keeping the user informed on the system status at any given time. For example, users know when a song is paused or playing due to the recognizable “play” and “pause” icon in the center of the screen. Users also know how much time has passed in a song and how much is left based on the horizontal progress bar on the listening interface. When scrolling through playlists, the title of the song that is currently playing is highlighted in green while other songs' titles remain in white. In addition, users know when the app is buffering or has weak connection because a “reconnecting…” message appears at the bottom of the screen. Also, when downloading music, a conventional loading circle next to the song title lets the user know that a song is actively downloading, whereas a static, grey download icon means the song has yet to begin downloading. All of these components effectively inform the user on the system status of the app. 

Score: 1

![Spotify Visibility](https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/themes/ap2/ap_resize/ap_resize.php?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidpolice.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F03%2Fspotify-now-playing-newer.png&w=728)

## 2: Match Between System and the Real World

Spotify uses conventional language and intuitive design that reflects real world trends. It uses commonly known words like “albums”, “artists”, “pause”, and “playlists”. The album interface is somewhat skeuomorphic in design as musical albums and playlists resemble physical albums in the real world. In addition, skipping from song to song feels similar to turning pages in a physical book from left to right. Overall, Spotify uses consumer friendly language and design elements that intuitively resemble real world physics and processes.

Score: 1

![spotify match](https://community.spotify.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/100063i7DC64BADE8A1E12A/image-size/medium?v=1.0&px=400)

## 3: User Control and Freedom

The app lends the user much freedom and control by including redo functions throughout. For instance, if a listener accidentally skips a song, he/she can simply press the back arrow button to the left of the play button to return to the previous song. When navigating playlists, a user can tap to see the contents of a playlist and easily back out by clicking the left-pointing arrow in the upper left hand corner of the screen. Should a user accidentally add a song to the queue, he/she can swipe the opposite direction to undo that action. Also, volume control is accessible and easy to alter. The user can simply slide a button left and right to decrease and increase the volume respectively. Thus, Spotify excels in giving the user a sense of freedom and control.

Score: 1

![spotify user](https://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NextUp-2.jpg)

## 4: Consistency and Standards

Internal Consistency: Everything within Spotify is consistent. Playlists are all depicted as square album-like images with a bolded white title to the right of them. Any song, playlist, or album that is downloaded onto the local device is accompanied by a green circle with a black arrow pointing down. The listening interface is consistent from song to song, with a pause/play button in the lower middle of the screen, above which sits a timeline bar indicating the time surpassed as the music plays. Every song title is bolded in white, and its artist is written below in light gray.

External Consistency: Spotify is largely consistent with other music/media applications such as Apple Music. Its interface features the conventional layout, with the pause/play button centered on the screen and left and right arrows allowing users to skip to the next/previous songs. The language that Spotify uses is pretty universal. Both Apple Music and Spotify allow users to create custom “playlists” or to download “albums”.  Overall, Spotify is internally consistent and new-user friendly due to its strong external consistency. 

Score: 1

![spotify consistency](https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/pi8lNp4qRgHT6sKtJ-iS90TArmQ=/1092x0/2018/09/07/be7a6c0d-07d9-4ed9-b349-3fe5e8336b91/applemusic-spotify.jpg)

## 5: Error Prevention

Spotify has effective error prevention methods, but the app is still vulnerable to minor user error. For example, a user may accidentally swipe to download an album, which automatically begins downloading the album contents without warning. Protection from annoying errors like this is a potential area of improvement. But beyond small errors like accidentally skipping or pausing songs, Spotify’s design works well in preventing errors. If a user wants to delete an entire playlist, he/she have to navigate through several dropdowns, making this difficult to do on accident. In addition, if a user accidentally undownloads all songs from a playlist, he/she will be prompted with an “Are you sure?” message. In sum, Spotify fails to prevent small user errors, but its overall design forces users to be deliberate in high-stake actions, thus preventing costly errors. 

Score: 2

## 6: Recognition Over Recall 

Spotify rarely demands that the user recalls any specific information. If a user wants to find certain music, they can look up a genre, author, or keywords, and the app's search engine will provide a list of suggestions. These suggestions are recognizable and make music navigation quicker and easier. In addition, playlists in Spotify are supplemented with album-like images that contain pictures of the albums within the playlist. This allows the user to recognize playlist content by the album covers rather than forcing him/her to memorize the specific songs that are in that music file. If the user forgets the name of a song that he/she recently listened to, Spotify offers a 'recently played' function so that the user doesn't need to remember the specific details of the song in order to find it. A potential area of improvement is integrating aural and lyrical recognition into Spotify's search systems. For instance, Spotify can add a feature that listens to music and identifies the song in its database. Perhaps if a user only remembers lyrics in the song, he/she can enter them into a lyrical search engine that searches for songs, overcoming the user's limited recall. In all, Spotify's emphasis on recognition-based navigation over recall-based navigation enhances the app's usability and experience, but there is still room for improvement. 

Score: 2

![spotify recall](https://community.spotify.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/102960i7273639434A951C3?v=1.0)

## 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

Spotify's design allows both expert music enthusiasts and music beginners to operate the app with ease and enjoyment. Experienced users can create an array of playlists and share them with others. They can create a music queue that specifies the exact order of music they listen to and can 'favorite' certain songs while removing others. People who are less enthusiastic and want a simple experience don't even need to construct a custom playlist. They can tap on a genre of music, and music will begin playing. They can listen to music without needing to know how to use the more complicated features of Spotify. Therefore, Spotify is flexible and efficient; it provides inexperienced with an enjoyable musical experience while allowing expert music enthusiasts to build a complex, organized collection of media.

## 8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

Spotify's interface features a black, green, and white color palette, consistent fonts, and an intuitive directory style navigation method. The simple and modern aesthetics make operating the app a simple and stress-free experience. In addition, the design is as minimalist as can be. For example, only the most relevant information is given on the music listening interface: the song title, author name, and a live time indicator. The interface does not include secondarily relevant information, but if a user is interested in a certain song, they can tap on the album for more information. In sum, Spotify's design is straightforward and aesthetically pleasing. Relevant information only is provided in an unambiguous way, and if users want to learn more, Spotify allows them to by including subtle design actions that do not clutter the interface.

## 9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

Spotify does a decent job of notifying the user of errors and how to recover from them. For instance, if a user is offline, the app notifies him/her with a message: "You're Offline". If a user attempts to download too many songs, Spotify will prompt the user with an error message explaining that the user is out of storage. Also, non-premium users who try to engage in premium member actions will be notified of this restriction and what they need to do to become a premium member (granted, this feels more like a marketing technique than an error processing design strategy). Spotify does the bare minimum when it comes to diagnosing and suggesting solutions to errors. It tells the user what the issue is, but it does not explain possible solutions in much detail. Therefore, error processes could be an area of improvement for Spotify.

## 10: Help and Documentation

Spotify, again, does the bare minimum when it comes to help and documentation. The app has an 'about' section where the user can access terms and conditions, privacy policy, and other official documents. However, should the user have a question that falls outside of these guidelines, there is nowhere else to turn. There is no FAQ section, no chat box, no customer feedback form, and no 'find out more' tab. Without any customer support contact information, the user is forced to search for answers on the internet. In sum, the lack of troubleshooting guidance and basic assistance outlets makes Spotify weak in the help and documentation category of evaluation. I think Spotify can improve in this area by providing a live chat box for questions or a FAQ section.
