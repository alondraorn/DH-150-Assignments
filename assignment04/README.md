# DH 150 Assignment 04: Contextual Inquiry by Josh Mimura

*** 



## Project Design Challenge

Before the digital revolution, the sports community was indeed smaller than it is today, but it was more tightly knit. A higher percentage of sports fans actually attended in-person games and events. Local pubs and restaurants were filled to the brim with eager sports fans who could not afford tickets to the game. Men and women had to wait for the morning paper or the nightly news to see how their teams performed earlier in the week. Fans would gather to talk about season trends and their favorite players. 

The rise of digital technology and the internet has increased accessibility to the sports world but has reduced the social cohesion of the sports community as a whole. People feel less of a need to attend sports games or gather at local bars. Information about sporting events is so immediate and accessible, that a basketball game feels like it occurs instantaneously and becomes less of a community experience. Sports are meant to be a collective expression of regional unity and excitement.
But today, when a city's favorite player scores a game winning touchdown, individual users celebrate alone as they look up from their phones with no one around to react with. In sum, the digitization of sports has reduced the strength of social bonds between the sports community.  

However, all is not lost. Digital sports apps, when designed well, have the power to build bridges within the sports community. The goal of this contextual inquiry is to explore the environmental, social, and physical context in which users of mobile sports apps operate, which will give us insight into how mobile sports apps, such as the UCLA Bruins Mobile App, can be better designed to restore the strength of the sports community.  

A target user that can give us a representative assessment of the sports community as a whole is hard to define. Members of the sports community are extremely diverse. Young and old, black and white, men and women; almost everyone has some connection to a local or national sports team. However, because we are interested in sports apps in particular, the target user is probably young and digitally literate. In addition, people who are most likely to use sports apps are probably busy and need a quick way to stay updated on the sports world. Also, anyone who downloads a mobile application dedicated to sports is surely a proud fan of at least a couple sports teams. Therefore, we can reasonably narrow the target user down to someone who is young, busy, and enthusiastic about sports. 

The target user will most likely log into sports apps during down time and leisure time throughout the day. For busy day workers, the lunch break is a good time to get caught up on sports news. In other common instances, users likely check their apps at the gym, in the restroom, or relaxing in their bedroom. The target user simply needs to log into their mobile device and enter their sports app. The low cost of doing so allow our target users to interact with digital sports apps from almost anywhere, places we might describe as "low-stakes, transitory settings".

## Research Methodology

I will conduct my contextual inquiry through participatory observation. I will visit a typical "low-stakes, transitory setting", a cafe where busy college students go on their lunch breaks. Here, I will passively observe and interact with the participant, who embodies the typical user of sports apps. 

The participant will be provided an explanation of the study and its procedures and will be required to give informed consent before we proceed with the contextual inquiry. Then, I will ask some basic background questions pertaining to the participant's interest in sports, use of sports apps, and connection to the sports community. Then, the participant will be tasked with an open-ended engagement to promote contextual insights: "Use a mobile sports application or any other method of accessing sports news to check in on the sports world. Find out what is happening in your leagues of interest, who the best teams are, and any other exciting pieces of information. You can also check in with your favorite team and your favorite player. How is the team and/or your favorite player performing this season?" During the exercise, I will ask the participant basic contextual questions about his relationship with sports and sports apps as well as probe the participant for additional explanation during specific tasks. 

After the user has completed the broad task, I will ask for the participant's feedback on his experience using the mobile sports app. I will also try to understand the overall satisfaction and frustration levels of the user as well as his opinions on possible design changes. 

Throughout the activity phase of the inquiry, I will take a backseat and let the user lead the way. I will collect data in two ways. First, I will write down field notes and observations on my laptop. Second, I will audio record the session, which will be transcribed for analysis. The participant will be notified that his identity will remain confidential.

## Reflection

I learned three main things about the context of mobile sports app users from this contextual inquiry. First, it seems that only the most invested sports fans download and use mobile sports applications. Sean's rationale for this is that there exist many alternatives to sports apps like Twitter and Instagram, both of which frequently report on popular sports events. Sean mentions that many of his friends do not have sports apps and get their news from more general sources like YouTube. As such, only those most interested in performance data, detailed news reports, and access to sports media take the time to download a mobile app dedicated to sports. (Note: I am not trying to generalize to all users. This is an insight produced from Sean's contextual inquiry) Second, mobile sports app users like Sean appreciate the accessibility and quickness of "score" interfaces. Sean is fluent in the "score" interface navigation as he easily checks the scores of past and occurring sports games. He explains that his main engagement on the ESPN app is to check scores and that these engagements last only a few minutes during his scattered periods of free time throughout the day. Thus, the ability to quickly enter the app, locate the desired score, and close the app seems to be an important criterion for mobile sports app users. Finally, I learned that sports engagement has largely been digitized. Sports fans like Sean still attend live sports events, but much less frequently than they watch them on a television or electronic device. In addition, most of Sean's conversations with others about sports occur online through Twitter or over text. Thus, increasing the social cohesion of the sports community will involve increasing the digital accessibility of shareable sports content and the interaction between sports users on online mediums.

Throughout the contextual inquiry, I also learned several things about the process itself. Most notably, I learned that the interviewer needs to be extremely flexible with the questions that he/she is asking. In my case, many of the questions that I asked were not pre-scripted in my interview guide. Conversely, I did not feel the need to ask some of the questions on the script, usually because the participant had already answered them. I felt like that questioning process during the background section and the user activity heavily depends on the flow and content of the session and cannot be 100% planned beforehand. I also learned that participants do not speak with conventional grammar. This became most apparent when I was editing the transcript as I realized that the participant often cut himself off, spoke in run-on sentences, and used many isolated sentence fragments. This seems to be a natural part of contextual inquiries. 

For the most part, the process went smoothly. The audio recording and transcript software was accurate and easy to work with. The participant understood each question and responded with rich answers. There is still room for improvement however. Firstly, I think the user-activity was not as deliberate as it should have been. While contextual inquiry activities are generally supposed to be broader in task, the user-activity in my interview felt like an extended conversation about the app, instead of me watching the participant doing something. Second, I had scheduled the interview to be around an hour, but it took a little over half that. I believe the participant ran out of activities to engage in, so we ended early. Next time, I should spend more time on the user-activity and ask more contextual questions.
