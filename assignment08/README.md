## Description

My DH 150 project analyzes and improves upon several design features of the UCLA Bruins App. The project consists of several methods of evaluation from task-based testing to contexual inquiries. The goal of this research is to understand how the design of the UCLA Bruins app helps or hinders the apps usability and how it can be modified to increase interaction within the sports community. 

This particular phase of the project involves developing a high-fidelity prototype of the new and improved design features that I am proposing for the UCLA Bruins App. The goal of developing a high-fidelity prototype is to visualize and vivify the content and interaction mechanisms behind the interface design in the most user-friendly way possible. It is a chance to test, retest, and tinker with interaction flow possibilities and design tradeoffs in order to produce the most usable product. Unlike the low-fidelity prototype, the high-fidelity prototype focuses more on specific design elements such as color, feedback, and spatial flow. Ultimately, this prototype can be used to communicate with and test users for further evaluation. 

## Tasks

This high-fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:  

1 Check scores 
  - check today's UCLA scores
  - view the current game summary of an ongoing game
  - check tomorrow's UCLA scores
  - view the game summary of a past game
  - view the game summary of a future game
2 Share audio or video content 
  - browse video and audio media content
  - pause/play audio content
  - send media content to other mobile users via SMS text message
3 Access team profile interface
  - view team profiles of UCLA football
  - access NOW, ROSTER, and SCHEDULE subinterfaces of UCLA football
  - view past performances, player statistics, and current rankings

## Peer Feedback 

Please submit one page documentation that contains your high-fidelity prototype:

One image with the representative examples of screen designs (3-5 screens) 
Description of your decision making of the graphical interface design, including the choice of the color scheme and note if you considered/checked accessibility color contrast.
One image with the wireflow with graphic design
Link to the interactive prototype or embed window that shows the prototype.
If you have multiple versions of prototypes by reflecting the evaluation with others, provide them with the description of what you learned from otherâ€™s feedback and what you have made the changes.
