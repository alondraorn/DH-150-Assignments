# DH 150 Assignment 01: 
# Heuristic Evaluation of the NFL Fantasy Football Mobile App by Josh Mimura

***

## Introduction

Every Sunday from September to January, millions of Americans tune into the NFL (National Football League) weekly games to cheer on their favorite teams. Many members of this sports community are involved in a league of their own - fantasy football. Fantasy football is a game in which enthusiastic fans draft and develop real world NFL players to create a virtual football team that competes with other fantasy teams in the fantasy football community. 

I chose to evaluate the NFL Fantasy Football App because it houses a community that brings me joy and excitement every week. I am a huge sports fan with a special love for football, and fantasy football allows me to exercise and express my knowledge and love for the NFL. I am interested in how the app’s design enhances or hinders its usability for the average user like me, who doesn’t usually analyze the app from a designer’s perspective. Given that Fantasy Football is enormously popular, every element of its design must be extremely strategic, however subtle it may be. I also want to learn how the usability design of the platform fosters a sense of community and connection with other fantasy football enthusiasts. Hopefully, my UX design will contribute to the football fan community by enhancing the usability of the NFL Fantasy Football App and by adding new features that strengthen the social ties between its members. 


## Description

The NFL Fantasy Football App is a mobile application platform for virtual football competition between users. At the beginning of the NFL season in September, users create a league with their friends and family, and create a team by drafting real-world football players. The goal is to create a team that produces good results in the real world, as the outcome of the fantasy football competition is determined by how well a user's players do from week to week. The NFL regular season is 16 weeks long. Each week, users in the fantasy football league match up against other users in the league. At the end of the season, the user with the most wins claims victory, or in some leagues, the top four users enter an elimination playoff. 

The App has many other features that allow the user to analyze a player's past and future performance in order to construct a higher scoring team. Users have access to live in-game highlights and notable NFL news such as injuries or trades. For more information on how Fantasy Football works, see here.

NFL Fantasy Football can be downloaded as a mobile app or used on a web browser. I will evaluate the usability of the application. This link will allow you to download the app, but it can also be downloaded on the Apple App Store. [http://www.nfl.com/mobile/fantasy](http://www.nfl.com/mobile/fantasy). This is the link to the browser version of Fantasy Football, but my evaluation is on the mobile version. [https://fantasy.nfl.com](https://fantasy.nfl.com)

## Overall Evaluation

In one sentence, the NFL Fantasy Football App gets the job done. That is, it is a functional tool that I use to manage my fantasy team, analyze player performances, and monitor my weekly matchups. The structural design of the app is simple, and navigation is easy. For users like me who have played fantasy for a long time, the app is quickly learned and immediately functional. I can search for players easily, request a trade with another user, and optimize my weekly lineups with a few taps. I can also conduct more detailed statistical analysis because the app provides data on every player's past, present, and future (projected) performance. The app is extremely flexible for both beginner users and expert users and uses conventional football language. Thanks to the constant warning messages and expert advice, I avoid making errors that could hurt my fantasy team. 

I think the usability of this app can be improved most by redesigning the boring roster/statistical interfaces to be more skeuomorphic. As of now, the team management interface is functional, but not structurally intuitive. It simply lists players from top to bottom - a boring and tedious way to display a user's fantasy team. In addition, the fantasy football experience can be improved by expediting player evaluation process. For instance, instead of having to look at multiple statistics to judge a player's worth, a user should be able to evaluate player's more quickly using just one or two composite indicators. Finally, fantasy football is all about competition. The addition of more interactive functions like built-in wagers, more exciting trash talk chats, and shareable highlight clips should strengthen the social aspect of the user experience.  

## 1: Visibility of System Status

The NFL Fantasy football app does a good job of keeping the user informed on the system status at any given time. Whenever a page is loading or buffering, the universal circular loading sign appears on the center of the screen. Should the connection be poor, a "something went wrong" message accompanied by an exclamation point icon appears on the screen. In addition, the scroll bar on the right side of the screen tells the user where he/she is relative to the bottom of the page. 

When a user is scrolling through league matchups for a certain week, a horizontal line of blue buttons indicates which matchup the user is looking at. That is, if there are 5 matchups in the league, there are five buttons at the bottom that tells the user which matchup is currently on the interface. If a user wants to edit his/her lineup, the up and down arrows next to each player's name lets the user know that the app is currently in edit mode. 

Overall, the visibility of system status is strong on the NFL Fantasy Football App.

Severity Rating: 1

## 2: Match Between System and the Real World

While the lack of skeuomorphic design does not threaten the basic functionality of the app, the NFL Fantasy Football App can improve its design by matching its system with real world concepts more often. For example, the roster interface of the app is structured as a list. A user's 10 player team is simply listed from top to bottom, with the player position to the left of the player face. However, this design is not as intuitive as, say, if the roster interface took the form of a football formation. Football fans are familiar with football formations and seeing a roster in a real-life football formation is more intuitive than seeing a roster in a top to bottom list. 

Current Roster Interface:

More Skeuomorphic Roster Interface:

The NFL Fantasy Football App excels in its use of conventional language. Using words and abbreviations that members of the sports community are familiar with like "roster", "QB", "TD", etc., the app's diction connects its systems well to the real world. For example, if a user were to trade a player to another user's team, the app coding would engage in something the average user would not be familiar with. However, the app simply calls this a "trade", something that makes sense to the average football fan.

In sum, the NFL Fantasy Football App can do a better job of matching its system with the real world, but it's lack of intuitive design structure in certain interfaces does not noticeably hinder the user's experience.

Severity Rating: 2

## 3: User Control and Freedom

The NFL Fantasy Football App's strongest area of design is in the amount of user control and freedom users have when using it. More generally, the user can always back out of player profiles by tapping the X in the top right hand corner of the screen. On other interfaces, users can tap the back arrow located in the top left hand of the screen to return to the previous menu. The five menu tabs at the bottom of the screen allow for quick navigation to different interfaces. This allows the user to travel from one page to a completely different page with one tap, as opposed to having to navigate back out to a master directory and back in to the desired page.

The app excels in offering user control in the player search interface. The user can filter the player search by position, availability of player, season year, projected scores, trends, and present stats. Each player profile provides the players rank, average # of points, % owned, and bye week (the week the player does not play). In addition, the profile provides data on the points scored week to week throughout the season as well as projected points for the rest of the year. These statistical features are critical in Fantasy Football since the goal of the game is to pick the best performing players. As such, user control and freedom is what I appreciate most about the NFL Fantasy Football App's user experience.

Severity Rating: 1

## 4: Consistency and Standards

Internal Consistency: The NFL Fantasy Football App is, for the most part, internally consistent. User profiles always appear as circular pictures with the user's league rank to the upper left hand side of the profile. The user name lies below his/her profile picture with the user's league record to the right. NFL player profiles are also consistent, with their names bolded above their team, position, and number. Some errors with consistency occur when a user wants to back out of certain interfaces. In the player profile interface, the user must tap the "x" in the upper right corner, whereas in the "edit team" screen, the escape button is an arrow in the top left corner. Beyond this minor inconsistency, the app is easy to navigate due to its good overall internal consistency.

External Consistency: The NFL Fantasy Football App is not the only fantasy football app. ESPN and Yahoo also have their own mobile apps. The NFL app is again, for the most part, externally consistent. The roster interface is very similar to ESPN and Yahoo's roster interfaces as all three apps use a list structure to depict the user's roster. In addition, the matchup interface between Yahoo and NFL almost identical. Each of the user's players are located to the left and right of each other, with their current score in bolded black. The aggregate score of each user's team is located at the top of the page. The external consistency of the NFL Fantasy Football App makes the app's usability easier for  users who are familiar with other fantasy football formats.

Severity Rating: 1

## 5: Error Prevention

For many people, the weekend fantasy football league is a big deal, and accidentally dropping or trading away a player could be devastating for a user's team. As such, the NFL Fantasy Football App is designed well to prevent errors. If a user wants to drop a player, the user must confirm the decision when the app asks, "Are you sure?". Similarly, when adding a player to a lineup, the user must "confirm add" and drop any players that exceed the roster limit. In addition, the app notifies the user of injured or inactive players on the starting roster with colored icons next to a players name. If a player is out, a yellow "O" sits next to his name, allowing the user to swap out the inactive player for an active one. Injury notifications are a crucial part of error prevention and have saved me multiple times from accidentally playing an inactive player. Another more subtle method of error prevention is by providing score projections for the following weeks of each player. This allows the user to make the best decision on which players to play that week. If a player is projected to score very low, it might be a good idea to put them in reserves. In sum, the app's design and features do a great job of preventing costly user errors.

The small gray numbers to the right side of each player is a projected score for that week. This error prevention method helps the user avoid playing E.Ebron this week, who will probably score fewer points than T.Kelce. 

Severity Rating: 1

## 6: Recognition rather than Recall

The NFL Fantasy Football App does not require much recall from the user at all. The primary instance in which a user needs to remember something is when the user is looking for a specific player in the app database. The app provides an effective search system that does not require the user to recall the specific name of the player. Rather, the user only has to know what position the desired player plays. If the user knows that the desired player is a quarterback, then the user can filter search results for just quarterbacks. The search engine generates a list of players names that are supplemented with logos of the teams they are on and a portrait picture of each player. In addition, at the top of the player search interface is a "Most Added Players" section which offers the user a quick way to add a desired player based on the popularity of the player they are looking for. As such, the user rarely needs to recall specific details about a player to find them. All the user needs to know is what the player's position, what team they play for, or what the player looks like. Overall, the nature of fantasy football does not demand that the user have a good memory, but in the circumstances in which the user must remember something, the app reduces the need to recall with a search system that emphasizes recognition.

Severity Rating: 1

## 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

The NFL Fantasy Football App offers a limited number of features that make the user experience enjoyable and efficient for both expert level users and beginners. For example, when drafting players at the beginning of the season, expert users can analyze the player pool and set their pre-draft order. During the draft, they can assign players to their queue to be auto-drafted during the next round. For beginners, the draft can be intimidating, so the app allows users to complete the draft based on pre-determined rankings by experts. That is, beginners who do not know how to draft can auto-draft their entire team without needing to go through the more complicated process of expert users. 

Another feature that increases the user's efficiency is the optimization function. This function allows the user to auto-generate the best projected roster for a given week without needing to manually switch players in and out of the lineup. Players who want more control over their team are still able to change their roster manually and do not have to optimize their roster based on the app's projected scores. 

![FF prevention](http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/fantasy/general/fan_images_league-types.png)

I believe the app can improve when it comes to flexibility and efficiency of use. Expert users should be able to auto-add potential free agents without needing to monitor their availability status throughout the season. For instance, if I want Mark Ingram on my team, I should be able to tap a function that notifies me of his availability and automatically adds him to my team when possible. Another possible improvement that would make the fantasy football experience easier for beginners is to develop and aggregate rating measure for each player. This single rating will take into account multiple other predictors of success and can serve as a simple guide for beginners who are trying to decide who to put on their team. This experience contrasts the current tedious experience in which users need to analyze players using many statistics such as play time, style of offense, and past performance.

Severity Rating: 2

## 8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

Using a white, turquoise, and gray color palette, the NFL Fantasy Football App provides the user with a aesthetically acceptable interface. Headings and sections are rectangular with smooth corners and are all in readable font. Colors do not clash, and even small text is readable. Player profiles feature light logo backgrounds that do not interfere with the player pictures and add flavor to the interface. 

The design is also quite minimalist, given the amount of information a user needs to be successful in fantasy football. The roster interface provides a picture, name, and total points of each player with details about the team they play for and their position. The top of the interface shows the user's league record and any win or loss streak he/she might be on. There are options to trade, manage waivers, or add players. The information given on the roster interface is necessary and informative. Some elements such as the player picture may be unnecessary, but without them, the interface lacks spirit. 

![FF prevention](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1UC1ltYuF_ddHJvOLedElpBsmvqXlI8B2)

The player profile is also minimalist in design. Each player has five summary statistics at the top with information about the latest matchup below. Clicking the "stats" tab allows the user to see more in-depth data about that player and his past performances. There are no unnecessary graphics or text. 

![FF prevention](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HNOTmuHg26RqYUyOqtrJHFlLYew_KXb3)

Overall, the NFL Fantasy Football App is aesthetically acceptable and not too cluttered with information. There may be some room to improve upon the app in this regard such as changing to a richer color palette or reducing the amount of numbers on certain interfaces, but the current state of the app's aesthetics does not undermine the user experience to any noticeable extent. 

Severity Rating: 1

## 9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

The NFL Fantasy Football App does a poor job of notifying, diagnosing, and recovering from system errors. The most common error I ran into when testing was a connection error. Lacking internet service, the app prompts the user with a "Something went wrong" message. This tells the user that there is an error but does not describe what the error is or how to fix it. This hurts the user experience because this vague message leaves the user uninformed and unable to fix the issue. 

![FF prevention](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1J8h8P4CnwU6nymX5eGZJsCSJ8Pslb-tO)

I was unable to trigger other error processing notifications during my testing, but based on what I observed, I believe the app has much room for improvement in this area. For instance, the app should identify what the problem is and suggest concrete steps to fix it. If it is a connection or loading error, it is better that the user knows, so that he/she can try to fix it. The sooner and smoother the user can get past these errors, the sooner he/she can get back to enjoying the app. 

Severity Rating: 2

## 10: Help and Documentation

The NFL Fantasy Football App excels when it comes to help and documentation. The app provides basic documents like the terms and conditions and the privacy policy. Further, there is a search system in the settings tab that allows users to ask questions and look up key words. For instance, if a user wants to learn how to add and drop players, he/she can turn to this search system (see below). Also, the home page interface features articles that help users with fantasy football strategies and predictions. Every week, for example, NFL.com publishes recommendations on which players should start and which players should stay in reserves. Overall, the NFL Fantasy Football App provides an abundance of resources for users who have questions about the functionality of the app itself and for users who want to effectively compete in their fantasy football league.
