# Heuristic Evaluation of the UCLA Bruins Mobile App by Josh Mimura

***

## Introduction

Producing more than 100 national titles and 250 Olympic medals, UCLA's prestigious division one athletic programs are historic, high-achieving, and exciting. Our success has fostered school spirit and a strong sports community at UCLA. However, most individuals in the UCLA community are busy students, and as such, need an efficient platform for keeping up with sports scores, events, and news. 

I chose to evaluate the UCLA Bruin mobile app because it cultivates and empowers the UCLA sports community. For sports enthusiasts like me, the UCLA Bruin app allows users to quickly access sports scores, buy tickets, and watch highlights. I am interested in how the app’s design enhances or hinders its usability for the average user like me, who doesn’t usually analyze the app from a designer’s perspective. I also want to learn how the usability design of this app increases the cohesiveness of the UCLA sports community. Hopefully, my UX design will contribute to this community by enhancing the usability of the UCLA Bruin app and by adding new features that can strengthen the social ties between its members.

## Description

The UCLA Bruin mobile app is a digital medium that provides information and functions related to ongoing UCLA sports. The user can check boxscores, watch highlights, buy tickets, and assess team performances. The app allows the user to personalize his/her experience by "subscribing" to specific sports. In doing so, the user can recieve more detailed and frequent updates about his/her sport of interest. The app also provides free live radio and on demand content that covers UCLA sports. 

The UCLA Bruins mobile app can be downloaded on the Apple or Google Play store. You can download the app through the following linkg:[https://uclabruins.com/sports/2014/8/22/209612683.aspx](https://uclabruins.com/sports/2014/8/22/209612683.aspx)

## Initial Evaluation

The UCLA Bruins mobile app serves an important purpose as the only app that informs UCLA fans about UCLA specific sports affairs. However, the app features few strengths in its usability design. Of them, the app excels in allowing users to personalize their experiences by subscribing to specific sports and receiving notifications on game start times, game end times, and scoring updates specific to their subcriptions. In addition, the app offers a quick way of listening to radio and watching videos in one tap of a button. Beyond these strengths, many usability inefficiencies descrease the quality of the user experience. Most alarmingly, the home interface of the app is extremely cluttered. It is not aesthetically pleasing and far from minimalist. The schedule interface is also difficult to use as temporal navigation is unintuitive and requires the user to open a calendar. There are also issues with internal consistency such as the two redundant menu systems at the bottom of the screen and on the left-hand side of the screen. The usability of this app can be improved by, among other things, getting rid of extraneous information in its home interfaces, integrating skeuomorphic elements into its calendar navigation functions, and simplifying the app's cluttered menu interfaces. Improving the app's usability and adding other features like live chat rooms and shareable highlight clips can strengthen the sense of community among UCLA sports fans. 
 

## 1: Visibility of System Status

The UCLA Bruins mobile app does a minimally satisfactory job of keeping the user informed on the system status. For example, if the user is not connected to the internet, the app does not inform the user of an issue. Instead, the system interface just remains blank. The user has no idea whether the system has crashed or is still loading. If the user is looking for games on the event schedule, the interface appears blank when there are no games that day. This is uninformative because the user does not know whether the system is still loading or if there are no events on that day. These inefficiencies overshadow the app's other effective mechanisms of communicating system status such as: using a scroll bar on the right-hand side of the screen, highlighting the current interface icon in yellow at the bottom of the screen, and indicating the current date as blue on the schedule interface. The visibility of the app's system status can be improved by incorporating a "loading" message or "failed to connect" message. Also, the app should tell the user what a blank screen means; does it mean that the app crashed? does it mean that there are no games on this day?

## 2: Match Between System and the Real World

The UCLA Bruin can improve its design by matching its system with real world concepts more often. For example, the radio interface of the app is structured as a list. This way of presenting media is more rare in the real world. Instead of a list, which is hard to read through, the app can utilize a more spatially aesthetic presentation of radio podcasts. Perhaps each radio podcast can be supplemented with a thumbnail that indicates what topic the podcast is about. In addition, the app forces the user to open a calendar to check events more than four days in advance. This function is not intuitive because most temporal navigation systems in the real world allows the user to swipe to the left and right across dates. Because the schedule interface does not allow for this, it decreases the efficiency with which the user can find future sporting events.

On the other hand, this app does a good job using conventional, user-friendly language. It does not use complicated technical terms or sports concepts. The bottom headings are easy to understand: "Home", "Schedule", "You", "Videos", "Audio, "By Tickets". Other diction like "Men's Tennis at 7:00 pm" uses language that you hear in real world sports circles, so users will not be confused by inaccesible language in the app.

Severity Rating: 2

## 3: User Control and Freedom

The UCLA Bruins mobile app does a decent job of giving the user control and freedom while navigating its interfaces. The standing menus at the bottom of the screen allows the user to quickly switch back and forth between interfaces with one tap of the screen. Anytime the user opens a sub-menu, he/she can tap the "done" button in the bottom left-hand corner. In every interface is a sidebar menu option in the top left-hand corner that lets the user quickly navigate to other pages such as "Account manager login" and "Fan zone". The audio interface allows the user switch between "live" radio and "on demand" radio by tapping the respective label once. Overall, the UCLA Bruins mobile app is satisfactory when it comes to user control and freedom.

Severity Rating: 1

## 4: Consistency and Standards

Internal Consistency: The UCLA Bruins app struggles with internal consistency. Most notably, the double menu system is redundant and ineffective. You can both "buy tickets" in the sidebar menu as well as the static menu at the bottom of the screen. This inconsistency clutters the interface and confuses the user who doesn't know which menu leads to which pages. In addition, the mechanism by which the user exits a page is different depending on the page. If the user is in the sidebar menu, he/she has to tap the menu icon to close it. On the other hand, if the user is on the game interface, he/she has to tap the "done" button at the boddon of the screen. This inconsistency also hinders efficient usability. This issue can be improved by integrating both menu systems into one that is collectively exhaustive.

External Consistency: The UCLA Bruins app is not externally consistent for two reasons. First, the app is very unique in that it is a sports information platform for one specific school. There is not an industry-wide benchmark on what these apps are suppoed to look like. However, this app still falls into a broader category of sports apps such as ESPN and The Score. These apps are similar information platforms that provide users with sports content from all sports in every part of the world. Thus, the second reason why this app is not externally consistent is because it is very different in structure and design to other sports apps. The biggest inconsistency is the calendar interface. The UCLA Bruin's caledar interface app is uninformative and does not allow the user to switch dates easily. It simply tells the use how many events are on that day. The Score's calendar interface is not in a calendar format, but allows the user to easily slide from date to date, each providing a list of matchups by sport and their respective scores. Other elements of external inconsistencies can be found in the subcription system. The UCLA Bruins app doesn't provide a team profile interface that The Score does (see the Fresno State Bulldogs football profile below).

## 5: Error Prevention

The UCLA Bruins app is less a tool than an information platform. The only major action that the user engages in is buying tickets. This process has many error prevention techniques such as requiring a login and making the user choose the specific sport and the event they want to buy a ticket for. This process takes several steps and prevents the user from accidentally buying a ticket. Other than this, the error prevention system is neither a hinderance nor a strong point of the app. When the user clicks on a podcast, it immediately starts playing without any warning. Similarly, should the user accidentally tap on a "+" sign next to a sport, the app will automatically subscribe the user to that sport, resulting in unwanted notifications. On the other hand, the app prompts the user with a confirmatory warning before they subscribe to the UCLA calendar. In sum, the error prevention system of the app is inconsistent, but exists during important transactions such as ticket purchases.

## 6: Recognition rather than Recall


The nature of the UCLA Bruins app does not require much recall from the user at all. However, the one instance in which recall is involved occurs when the user needs to remember when a specific game was or will occur. For instance, if a user wants to go to a game next week, he/she needs to remember the specific date, sport, and time. Unforunately, the app does not help the user much in this process. As mentioned, the schedule interface only indicates the number of events occuring each day of the week. It does not give the user any clues as to which type of sport is playing each day. In addition, the app does not provide any specific information on where the games will take place, forcing users who want to attend these events to recall the specific details themselves. 

![B6](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1lWNQyeZso_Ui4KX3p34YN6qbFnpRx3F_)


Another example of a failure to use enough recognition design is in the box score interface. Here, we see the name and number of the players along with their statistics for the game, but we often forget the specific names of the players relative to what they look like. A more effective design might be to include a picture of each player. This would allow the user to associate the name and appearance together instead of making them match the names to appearances from scratch. Ultimately, including more recognition-based visuals would make box scores easier to interpret.

## 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

The UCLA Bruins app is a beginners app. That is, it lacks features that make the expert user's experience more efficient and flexible. An unavoidable reason for this is that the nature of the app is simplistic. It is meant to be an information platform for those seeking basic news on the sports world. It is not a statistics app that lets users to conduct sports analytics on UCLA sports performance. As such, there is little room to make the functional experience "faster" for expert users. However, there is still some potential to make their experience a more efficient one. Perhaps the app should integrate a filter function into the calendar that allows expert users to filter certain sports in and out of the schedule interface. Also, users should be able to follow specific players and their performances throughout the season. A subcription system to players as well as teams would allow expert users to use the app according to their specific desires. Meanwhile, beginner users can keep using the app as a quick score report during the weekend. 

The one feature that allows expert users to differentiate their experience is the team subscription system. As mentioned, this system allows users to selectively follow certain UCLA sports, allowing them to receive more detailed notifications and reports about their chosen sport.

Severity Rating: 2

## 8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

The aesthetics of the UCLA Bruins app is its weakest heuristic category of them all. Every interface is appears cluttered and complicated. Take the home interface for example. Why is there a picture of a bear with a small UCLA logo in the bottom left-hand corner of the image. This picture seems to serve no purpose. Right below this picture is a mustard yellow banner that indicates the number of games in the upcoming week. This is vague, uninformative, and thus unnecessary information to have on the homepage of the app. 

![B7](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1lWNQyeZso_Ui4KX3p34YN6qbFnpRx3F_)

The schedule page is almost as confusing. The top of the page has a horizontal bar of calendar dates, below which is a blue banner that says the spells out the date highlighted above. Below is a mustard yellow banner that says "upcoming". This text is redundant and useless, creating unnecessary clutter in the interface. 

![B7](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1lWNQyeZso_Ui4KX3p34YN6qbFnpRx3F_)

The audio page is not aethetically pleasing. Podcasts are listed in a top to bottom structure that appears boring and tedious. The bland aethetics of this page detract from the user experience. As previously mentioned, this interface could be benefitted by adding more visual aids and using a more intuitive spatial structure.

![B8](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1lWNQyeZso_Ui4KX3p34YN6qbFnpRx3F_)

The UCLA Bruins app could massively improve in its aesthetic by sticking with a compatible color palette, maintaining internal consistency, and providing only the information necessary in each interface. 

Severity Rating: 3

## 9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

The UCLA Bruins app does a por job of identifying errors and providing useful steps to solving them. During my testing, I triggered the common connection error by turning off my service, and the app did not notify me of any error. It simply stopped loading and remained on a blank screen. This error process may leave the user confused and unable to solve the problem. A "unable to connect. please reconnect to the internet" message would be much more helpful. I was not able to trigger any other system errors during my testing, but based on what I observed, I believe the app has much room for improvement in this area. It should supplement error messages with a concrete list of steps on how to solve a given error.

![B9](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1lWNQyeZso_Ui4KX3p34YN6qbFnpRx3F_)

The app allows users to recover from function errors such as accidentally subscribing to a specific sport. The user simply has to click the red "x" next the sport to stop subscribing. Overall, the app allows users to recover quickly from user errors, but it does not provide informative feedback when system errors occur. 

![B9](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1lWNQyeZso_Ui4KX3p34YN6qbFnpRx3F_)

Severity Rating: 2

## 10: Help and Documentation

The UCLA Bruins app is weak when it comes to help and documentation. The app does not provide basic documents lik the terms and conditions or the privacy policy. There is no search system that allows users to look up keywords or questions. There is no chatbox, FAQ, or contact information for customer support. The lack of user assistance materials makes the app difficult to explore. I found myself not wanting to click on menu options because I did not know what they were or how to use them. This app can drastically improve if it included a user FAQ or contact information for customer support. As of now, the help and documentation aspect of this app is non-existent which hinders the user experience of beginners. 

Severity Rating: 3
