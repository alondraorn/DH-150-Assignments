## Project Summary

This project examines the role the UCLA Bruin's app plays in strengthening cohesion within the sports community by providing mobile access to sports news, scores, and highlights. It also attemps to understand the deficiencies of the app and how the design can be improved. 

Through contextual user research, I have learned several things about how members of the sports community might use news apps like the UCLA Bruins app and what design areas can be improved based on this. First, efficiency is extemely important to sports app users. They express their desire to be able to quickly check a score on the sport, without having to go online and manually look up an ongoing game. Second, people in the sports community often talk with their friends about sports in person, but have less opportunities to do so outside of face-to-face interactions. The current UCLA Bruins app does not capitalize on this opportunity since it does not have an accesisble sharing feature that might allow more online interaction in the sports community. Finally, I observed that users of sports apps are more likely to be deeply interested in sports, can recognize sports jargon, and appreciate skeuomorphic design elements that mirror familiar sports concepts, such as a box score presented in a real-life score table format.

Based on this contexual research as well as other methods of evaluation, I modeled three personas that would be able to achieve their sports related goals with my design concepts. Like many sports app users, the day is busy and there is little time to spend looking for sports news. The busy user who needs quick access to scores is embodied through Brad. Other users, like Corbin, like to analyze ongoing sports leagues in more detail and would benefit from a team profile interface. Velma represents the people in the sports community that wish to be more involved and feel that digital technology has increased information accessibility, but has decreased the social interaction between fans. She would appreciate a feature that would allow her to share sports media with friends through a mobile device.

Given these personas and their needs, I have developed a low fidelity prototype that outlines three improved/new features of the UCLA Bruins app. These features include (1) a revamped "score" interface, (2) an informative "team profile" interface, and (3) a shareability feature that allows users to send media content to others through several digital mediums. Each feature would improve the user experience of Brad, Corbin, and Velma, respectively. The following wireframes and wireflows illustrate the process by which a user would use these new features. 

The purpose of the low-fidelity prototyping process is to layout how exactly the user will be interacting with the UCLA Bruins mobile app. Specifically, I want to understand how I can incorporate my three features into the app's logical sequence of interfaces in a functional and user-based way. I do this by sketching low-fidelity wireframes and use them to create wireflow sequences. Then, I have another user navigate through my wireflows to help me understand what works and what needs improvement in my current design. Using this information, I can refine and improve my low-fidelity prototype.

## Reflection

A description of what you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype.

Write a short paragraph reflecting on your experience of testing with a low-fidelity prototype. What did you learn about preparing a low-fidelity prototype? What would you do differently next time? How do you think you need to revise the low-fidelity prototype?
