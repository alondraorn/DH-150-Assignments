# DH 150: Assignment 08 by Josh Mimura

***

## Description

My DH 150 project analyzes and improves upon several design features of the UCLA Bruins App. The project consists of several methods of evaluation from task-based testing to contexual inquiries. The goal of this research is to understand how the design of the UCLA Bruins app helps or hinders the apps usability and how it can be modified to increase interaction within the sports community. 

This particular phase of the project involves developing a high-fidelity prototype of the new and improved design features that I am proposing for the UCLA Bruins App. The goal of developing a high-fidelity prototype is to visualize and vivify the content and interaction mechanisms behind the interface design in the most user-friendly way possible. It is a chance to test, retest, and tinker with interaction flow possibilities and design tradeoffs in order to produce the most usable product. Unlike the low-fidelity prototype, the high-fidelity prototype focuses more on specific design elements such as color, feedback, and spatial flow. Ultimately, this prototype can be used to communicate with and test users for further evaluation. 

## Tasks

This high-fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:  

1) Check scores 
  - check today's UCLA scores
  - check tomorrow's UCLA scores
  - view the game summary of an ongoing game
  - view the game summary of a past game
  - view the game summary of a future game

2) Share audio or video content 
  - browse video and audio media content
  - pause/play audio content
  - send media content to other mobile users via SMS text message

3) Access team profile interface
  - view team profiles of UCLA football
  - access NOW, ROSTER, and SCHEDULE subinterfaces of UCLA football
  - view past performances, player statistics, and current rankings

During my research, I found that sports app users care most about efficiency and simplicity when trying to access sports scores and news. As such, I used incorporated 4 static menu tabs at the bottom of most interfaces to allow for instant and accessibly navigation to different components of the app. If a user wants to quickly switch from media content to score content, they do not have to return to a main page and renavigate to the scores menu. They can just tap "scores". Each tab lights up yellow to indicate that the user is currently on that particular interface, increasing the visibility of system status. 

The first interface that the user is presented with is the "News" page. I kept this page simple and minimalist because the former home page of the UCLA Bruins App was cluttered with unnecessary information that made it difficult for the user to know where to go from there. The News interface is meant to provide a vertical feed of top news that the user can navigate through based on popularity or sport (as afforded by the tabs on the top of the screen).

On the "Scores" interface, I kept the information about each ongoing game to a minimum. I only included the opponent, score, and time left because including more information can crowd the interface with numbers and makes it more difficult for the user to identify essential information. If the user wants specific details about the game, he/she can tap on each gray box and they can see the scoring progression and a box score. Thus, the minimalist score interface with a more detailed game interface allows user's in a hurry to quickly see the score and provides more interested users with the opportunity to analyze the game in more detail. 

I found that checking games in the past or in the future was difficult on the UCLA Bruins Mobile app because there was no dynamic calendar function. The user would have to click on a calendar icon and click on specific dates. In order to overcome this inefficiency, I made the tabs on the top part of the screen fluid so that the user can scroll from date to date. This method of finding certain games are easier because the user just scrolls the upper tab menu instead of needing to open and close a static calendar.

On the "Team" interface, I use logos/shapes each sport. This allows the user to use visual associations to make decisions faster. It also increases accessibility for those who have reading impairements, but can recognize the universal symbol for each sport.

Unlike the former UCLA Bruins App, this prototype features a "team profile" interface, which allows the user to evaluate a team's performance during a certain season based on a concise and informative summary profile of each UCLA team. The user has access to relevant news pieces, roster statistics, and details about the team's schedule. Each of the three tabs at the top light up in yellow when the user is currently on that particular interface. This feedback informs the user on the system status. 

In addition, because there are many sports fans who like to understand sports based on numbers while avoiding biased opinions, the "Roster" and "Schedule" subtabs on the "Team Profile" interface present the several statistical indicators for each player/game, without cluttering the interface with too much text. 

I used the roboto font throughout because it is legible and professional. Also, it is less aggressive and rigid than are fonts like Times New Roman, which can seem overly professional. This app is not a business app or a legal database. Thus, roboto is a good balance, as it brings light-heartedness into the interfaces while avoiding a childish look. 

The basic color scheme I use is a soft, dark blue, a kind, mustard yellow, white, and black. I chose these colors for two main reasons. First, the topic of the app is UCLA sports, so it would be confusing to use non-UCLA colors. Second, these colors had great contrast, with ratios above 4.5 for each color combination. Though I ran into some issues with color scheme, (as I will discuss in the Peer Feedback Section) I was able to adjust the lightness of the blue and gold so that they achieved a high enough contrast ratio to each other as well as to black and white. For instance, the white on blue text is easily readable - as is the black on yellow text. Even though the black and blue are relatively well contrasted, I did not use these colors in a text-background relationship because these would be difficult to read in bright environemnts.

## Peer Feedback 

After reflecting on the suggestions and opinions of my peers and the professor, I made a couple of changes to my original prototype design/graphic interface:

1) Color

As noted above, I had some issues with my color scheme throughout my prototype development. Originally, I was using a dark gray as a prominent color in many interfaces. This gray contrasted well with yellow, but not much else. It did not contrast well with the dark blue and black text (despite passing the ratio test), and would make the interface difficult to read in bright environments. As you can see below, I chose to get rid of the dark gray color and use the yellow I had been using. I did this because yellow contrasts at a higher ratio than gray does with black and blue. It makes the interface much easier to navigate, especially in bright situations or when the screen is too dark. 

2) Headings

Another suggestion I received was to resize the headings at the top of my interfaces to make it more obvious to the user that he/she is currently operating under a specific interface. In the original prototype, the font size of the selected header was 16 compared to a font size of 13 for unselected headers. In the revised prototype, I increased the font size of the current interface heading to 18 so that the system status was more obvious to the user. (See size difference in image below). 

3) Edge radius

Several peers mentioned that the sharp edges of some of my design elements such as the "score" boxes made the interfaces seem too rigid and uninviting. They also pointed out that I had rounded the box elements in the "news" interface, but not in other interfaces like the "score" and "team" interfaces, which creates an arbitrary inconsistency. Given this, I chose to get rid of the sharp corners of the prominent interface elements throughout the prototype in order to create a softer interface as well as stay internally consistent throughout. 

4) Thumbnail Elongation

It was pointed out that the thumbnails/pictures I used in the original prototype lose their proper length and width ratios when stretched to fill the length of their corresponding design elements. Doing so made the pictures look weird and decreased the perceived quality of the interface. As a result, I resized the pictures so that they were proportional and used a black background to fill in the empty space. This black background is common in other media platforms to depict extra space that has not been taken up by an image.
