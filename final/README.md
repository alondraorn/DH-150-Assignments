# DH 150 Assignment 9: Josh Mimura

## UCLA Bruins App UX Project, Joshua Mimura

## Introduction: a brief information about the project. What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.

My DH 150 project analyzes and improves upon several design features of the UCLA Bruins Sports App. I chose to evaluate the UCLA Bruin mobile app because it cultivates and empowers the UCLA sports community. For sports enthusiasts like me, the UCLA Bruin app allows users to access sports scores, buy tickets, and watch highlights. The project consists of several methods of evaluation from task-based testing to contextual inquiries. The goal of this project is to understand how the design of the UCLA Bruins app helps or hinders the apps usability and how it can be modified to increase interaction within the sports community. This project will contribute to the UCLA sports community by adding features to the UCLA Bruins App that are more efficient, accessible, and allow for interaction between sports fans. 

## Clear design statement: What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project?

After a series of evaluation and testing, I determined that the UCLA Bruins app lacks in two main areas. First, the UCLA Bruins app needs to be quicker and more easily accessible. These attributes are extremely important to sports app users, who are usually busy and don't have time to surf the web for their sports news. Second, the UCLA Bruins app can do a better job of connecting users within the sports community. The sports community has lost some of its cohesion with the rise of digital technology, but if digital resources can incorporate features that spark interaction between users, the social cohesion of this community can be restored. 

## Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]: Summary and link to the heuristics and usability testing of the *existing* product(s) - or the *original* website you evaluated

I first conducted a hueristic evaluation of the UCLA Bruins App to analyze its initial design. Among other things, I found that the app had several inefficient interfaces with extraneous information. I also found that navigation was difficult because the app featured two menus, one at the bottom and a sidebar menu. Most notably, I noticed that there was no feature on the app that allows sports app users to interact with each other. The UCLA Bruins app had some strengths though, such as allowing users to personalize their experience by subscribing to specific sports.

Part of my initial valuation of the app involved comparing it to other sports apps. The two main competitors to the UCLA Bruins app are the ESPN sports app and The Score app. These apps provide sports news on worldwide sports, whereas the UCLA Bruins app only covers UCLA sports. Nevertheless, these two competitors serve as good reference points when evaluating the UCLA Bruins app. They featured more efficient and intuitive interfaces which informed some of my design choices in my final prototype.
