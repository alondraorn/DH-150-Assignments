# DH 150 Assignment 9: Josh Mimura

## UCLA Bruins App UX Project, Joshua Mimura

## Introduction: a brief information about the project. What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.

My DH 150 project analyzes and improves upon several design features of the UCLA Bruins Sports App. The project consists of several methods of evaluation from task-based testing to contextual inquiries. The goal of this project is to understand how the design of the UCLA Bruins app helps or hinders the apps usability and how it can be modified to increase interaction within the sports community.

## Clear design statement: What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 

## Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]: Summary and link to the heuristics and usability testing of the *existing* product(s) - or the *original* website you evaluated
