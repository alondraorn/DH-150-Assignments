# DH 150 Assignment 04: Contexual Inquiry by Josh Mimura

## Project Design Challenge

Before the digital revolution, the sports community was indeed smaller than it is today, but it was also more tightly knit. A higher percentage of sports fans actually attended in-person games and events. Local pubs and restaurants were filled to the brim with eager sports fans who could not afford tickets to the game. Men and women had to wait for the morning paper or the nightly news to see how their teams performed earlier in the week. Fans would gather to talk about season trends and their favorite players. 

The rise of digital technology and the internet has increased accessibility to the sports world, but has reduced the social cohesion of the sports community as a whole. People feel less of a need to attend sports games or gather at local bars. Information about sporting events is so immediate and accesible, that a basketball game feels like it occurs instantaneously and becomes less of a community experience. Sports are meant to be a collective expression of regional unity and excitement.
But today, when a city's favorite player scores a game winning touchdown, individual users celebrate alone as they look up from their phones with no one around to react with. In sum, the digitization of sports has reduced the strength of social bonds between the sports community.  

However, all is not lost. Digital sports apps, when designed well, have the power to build bridges within the sports community. The goal of this contextual inquiry is to assess the environmental, social, and physical context in which users of sports apps operate, which will give us insight into how sports apps, such as the UCLA Bruins Mobile App, can be better designed to restore the strength of the sports community.  

A target user that can give us a representative assessement of the sports community as a whole is hard to define. Members of the sports community are extremely diverse. Young and old, black and white, men and women; almost everyone has some connection to a local or national sports team. However, because we are interested in sports apps in particular, the target user is probably young and digitally literate. In addition, people who are most likely to use sports apps are probably busy and need a quick way to stay updated on the sports world. Also, anyone who downloads a mobile application dedicated to sports is surely a proud fan of at least a couple sports teams. Therefore we can reasonably narrow the target user down to someone who is young, busy, and enthusiastic about sports. 

The target user will most likely log into sports apps during down time and leisure time throughout the day. For busy day workers, the lunch break is a good time to get caught up on sports news. In other common instances, users likely check their apps at the gym, in the restroom, or relaxing in their bedroom. The target user simply needs to log into their mobile device and enter their sports app. The low cost of doing so allow our target users to interact with digital sports apps from almost anywhere, places we might describe as "low-stakes, transitory settings".






Step01: Specify the main design challenge 
What is the main activity your project would support the users?
- users check scores and keep up with the sports world and community, everyone has a REACTION, but often times, no one to share it with

What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)
- this is an expression of leisure and collective excitement for an athlete that represents a subset of the public

What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
- traditionally, people to go games, or check the newspaper
- now, people overwhelmingly get their sports news from the web, and communities in social media are able to center around sports

What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
- the challenge is that digital technology often weakens the community aspect of sports; you are not longer watching at a bar, not with friends, not outside the stadium; instead you just check on your phone 
- digital technology should do a better job of integrating community building features into sports apps in order to restore the social cohesion of sports communities.

Step02: Target users 
What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
- users vary greatly in almost all demographic categoeis
  - young and old
  - black and white
  - men and women
  - most have basic expertise about sports and some have a lot
  - EVERYONE SEES VALUE BECAUSE OF THE COMMUNITY, no value if no community
Where would the users do that activity?
- checking on scores can be done during leisure time or dead time during the day; this can be at home, or in the office, during a lecture, in between studying

What would the users do to complete that activity? 
- they usually just hop on their mobile device



## Research Methodology

I will conduct my contextual inquiry through participatory observation. I will visit a typical "low-stakes, transitory setting", a cafe where busy college students go on their lunch breaks. Here, I will passively observe and interact with the participant, who embodies the typical user of sports apps. He will be provided an explanation of the study and will be required to give informed consent before we proceed with the contexual inquiry. 

As the interviewer, I will take a backseat and let the participant guide the inquiry. He will be tasked with an open ended engagement to promote contexual insights: "check in on the sports world, what cathces your eye, what are you looking forward to." During the exercise, I will ask the participant basic contexual questions about his relationship with sports and sports apps as well as probe the participant for additional explanation during specific tasks. 

I will collect data in two ways. First, I will write down field notes and observations on my laptop. Second, I will audio record the session, which will be transcribed for analysis.




Step03: Pick an observation method (or a combination of methods) 
Interview with direct / Passive / Participatory observation* (recommended)
Or something you learned on your own (refer the field guideline by IDEO)

- participatory observation

Step04: Plan to get into the context & write down the observation/ interview guide 
Decide where to visit

- will visit someone on their lunch break who wants to check in with sports

Decide what activities to observe/ what to ask to do

- want them to check up on scores from the night before and other news
- want to understand to what extent the user goes beyond individual reaction and actually engages with others in the community


Decide how to interact with the users 
- interviewer will take a backseat and occasionally ask probing questions 

Decide how to collect user data (ex. Pen-paper notes, voice/video recording, images)
Prepare the interview guide (refer)
- interviewer will take notes on computer as well as voice record the session
