# Heuristic Evaluation of the UCLA Bruins Mobile App by Josh Mimura

***

## Introduction

Producing more than 100 national titles and 250 Olympic medals, UCLA's prestigious division one athletic programs are historic, high-achieving, and exciting. Our success has fostered school spirit and a strong sports community at UCLA. However, most individuals in the UCLA community are busy students, and as such, need an efficient platform for keeping up with sports scores, events, and news. 

I chose to evaluate the UCLA Bruin mobile app because it cultivates and empowers the UCLA sports community. For sports enthusiasts like me, the UCLA Bruin app allows users to quickly access sports scores, buy tickets, and watch highlights. I am interested in how the app’s design enhances or hinders its usability for the average user like me, who doesn’t usually analyze the app from a designer’s perspective. I also want to learn how the usability design of this app increases the cohesiveness of the UCLA sports community. Hopefully, my UX design will contribute to this community by enhancing the usability of the UCLA Bruin app and by adding new features that can strengthen the social ties between its members.

## Description

The UCLA Bruin mobile app is a digital medium that provides information and functions related to ongoing UCLA sports. The user can check boxscores, watch highlights, buy tickets, and assess team performances. The app allows the user to personalize his/her experience by "subscribing" to specific sports. In doing so, the user can recieve more detailed and frequent updates about his/her sport of interest. The app also provides free live radio and on demand content that covers UCLA sports. 

The UCLA Bruins mobile app can be downloaded on the Apple or Google Play store. You can download the app through the following linkg:[https://uclabruins.com/sports/2014/8/22/209612683.aspx](https://uclabruins.com/sports/2014/8/22/209612683.aspx)

## Initial Evaluation

The UCLA Bruins mobile app serves an important purpose as the only app that informs UCLA fans about UCLA specific sports affairs. However, the app features few strengths in its usability design. Of them, the app excels in allowing users to personalize their experiences by subscribing to specific sports and receiving notifications on game start times, game end times, and scoring updates specific to their subcriptions. In addition, the app offers a quick way of listening to radio and watching videos in one tap of a button. Beyond these strengths, many usability inefficiencies descrease the quality of the user experience. Most alarmingly, the home interface of the app is extremely cluttered. It is not aesthetically pleasing and far from minimalist. The schedule interface is also difficult to use as temporal navigation is unintuitive and requires the user to open a calendar. There are also issues with internal consistency such as the two redundant menu systems at the bottom of the screen and on the left-hand side of the screen. The usability of this app can be improved by, among other things, getting rid of extraneous information in its home interfaces, integrating skeuomorphic elements into its calendar navigation functions, and simplifying the app's cluttered menu interfaces. Improving the app's usability and adding other features like live chat rooms and shareable highlight clips can strengthen the sense of community among UCLA sports fans. 
 

## 1: Visibility of System Status

The UCLA Bruins mobile app does a minimally satisfactory job of keeping the user informed on the system status. For example, if the user is not connected to the internet, the app does not inform the user of an issue. Instead, the system interface just remains blank. The user has no idea whether the system has crashed or is still loading. If the user is looking for games on the event schedule, the interface appears blank when there are no games that day. This is uninformative because the user does not know whether the system is still loading or if there are no events on that day. These inefficiencies overshadow the app's other effective mechanisms of communicating system status such as: using a scroll bar on the right-hand side of the screen, highlighting the current interface icon in yellow at the bottom of the screen, and indicating the current date as blue on the schedule interface. The visibility of the app's system status can be improved by incorporating a "loading" message or "failed to connect" message. Also, the app should tell the user what a blank screen means; does it mean that the app crashed? does it mean that there are no games on this day?

## 2: Match Between System and the Real World

The UCLA Bruin can improve its design by matching its system with real world concepts more often. For example, the radio interface of the app is structured as a list. This way of presenting media is more rare in the real world. Instead of a list, which is hard to read through, the app can utilize a more spatially aesthetic presentation of radio podcasts. Perhaps each radio podcast can be supplemented with a thumbnail that indicates what topic the podcast is about. In addition, the app forces the user to open a calendar to check events more than four days in advance. This function is not intuitive because most temporal navigation systems in the real world allows the user to swipe to the left and right across dates. Because the schedule interface does not allow for this, it decreases the efficiency with which the user can find future sporting events.

On the other hand, this app does a good job using conventional, user-friendly language. It does not use complicated technical terms or sports concepts. The bottom headings are easy to understand: "Home", "Schedule", "You", "Videos", "Audio, "By Tickets". Other diction like "Men's Tennis at 7:00 pm" uses language that you hear in real world sports circles, so users will not be confused by inaccesible language in the app.

Severity Rating: 2

## 3: User Control and Freedom

The UCLA Bruins mobile app does a decent job of giving the user control and freedom while navigating its interfaces. The standing menus at the bottom of the screen allows the user to quickly switch back and forth between interfaces with one tap of the screen. Anytime the user opens a sub-menu, he/she can tap the "done" button in the bottom left-hand corner. In every interface is a sidebar menu option in the top left-hand corner that lets the user quickly navigate to other pages such as "Account manager login" and "Fan zone". The audio interface allows the user switch between "live" radio and "on demand" radio by tapping the respective label once. Overall, the UCLA Bruins mobile app is satisfactory when it comes to user control and freedom.

Severity Rating: 1

## 4: Consistency and Standards

Internal Consistency: The UCLA Bruins app struggles with internal consistency. Most notably, the double menu system is redundant and ineffective. You can both "buy tickets" in the sidebar menu as well as the static menu at the bottom of the screen. This inconsistency clutters the interface and confuses the user who doesn't know which menu leads to which pages. In addition, the mechanism by which the user exits a page is different depending on the page. If the user is in the sidebar menu, he/she has to tap the menu icon to close it. On the other hand, if the user is on the game interface, he/she has to tap the "done" button at the boddon of the screen. This inconsistency also hinders efficient usability.

![B3](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=18LBJhwTj2f4fwWVVyEMSw4B7b0vG4jhB)

External Consistency: The UCLA Bruins app is not externally consistent for two reasons. First, the app is very unique in that it is a sports information platform for one specific school. There is not an industry-wide benchmark on what these apps are suppoed to look like. However, this app still falls into a broader category of sports apps such as ESPN and The Score. These apps are similar information platforms that provide users with sports content from all sports in every part of the world. Thus, the second reason why this app is not externally consistent is because it is very different in structure and design to other sports apps. The biggest inconsistency is the calendar interface. The UCLA Bruin's caledar interface app is uninformative and does not allow the user to switch dates easily. It simply tells the use how many events are on that day. The Score's calendar interface is not in a calendar format, but allows the user to easily slide from date to date, each providing a list of matchups by sport and their respective scores. Other elements of external inconsistencies can be found in the subcription system. The UCLA Bruins app doesn't provide a team profile interface that The Score does (see the Fresno State Bulldogs football profile below).

## 5: Error Prevention

The UCLA Bruins app is less a tool than an information platform. The only major action that the user engages in is buying tickets. This process has many error prevention techniques such as requiring a login,  making the user choose the specific sport, and selecting the event they want to buy a ticket for. This process takes several steps and prevents the user from accidentally buying a ticket. Other than this, the error prevention system is neither a hinderance nor a strong point of the app. When the user clicks on a podcast, it immediately starts playing without any warning. Similarly, should the user accidentally tap on a "+" sign next to a sport, the app will automatically subscribe the user to that sport, resulting in unwanted notifications. On the other hand, the app prompts the user with a confirmatory warning before they subscribe to the UCLA calendar. In sum, the error prevention system of the app is inconsistent, but exists during important transactions such as ticket purchases.

error prevention processes are satisfactory

For many people, the weekend fantasy football league is a big deal and accidentally dropping or trading away a player could be devastating for a user's team. Fortunately, the NFL Fantasy Football App is designed well to prevent errors. If a user wants to drop a player, the user must confirm the decision when the app asks, "Are you sure?". Similarly, when adding a player to a lineup, the user must "confirm add" and drop any players that exceed the roster limit. In addition, the app notifies the user of injured or inactive players on the starting roster with colored icons next to a players name. If a player is out, a yellow "O" sits next to his name, allowing the user to swap out the inactive player for an active one. Injury notifications are a crucial part of error prevention and have saved me multiple times from accidentally playing an inactive player. Another more subtle method of error prevention is by providing score projections for each player. This allows the user to make the best decision on which players to play that week. If a player is projected to score very low, it might be a good idea to put them in the reserves. In sum, the app's design and features do a great job of preventing costly user errors.

The small gray numbers to the right side of each player is a projected score for that week. This error prevention method helps the user avoid playing E.Ebron this week, who is predicted to score fewer points than T.Kelce. 

Severity Rating: 1

## 6: Recognition rather than Recall

The NFL Fantasy Football App does not require much recall from the user at all. The primary instance in which a user needs to remember something is when the user is looking for a specific player in the app database. The app provides an effective search system that does not require the user to recall the specific name of the player. Rather, the user only has to know what position of the desired player. If the user knows that the desired player is a quarterback, then the user can filter search results for just quarterbacks. The search engine generates a list of players names that are supplemented with logos of the teams they are on and a portrait picture of each player. In addition, at the top of the player search interface is a "Most Added Players" section which offers the user a quick way to add a desired player based on the popularity of the player they are looking for. As such, the user rarely needs to recall specific details about a player to find them. All the user needs to know is what the player's position, what team they play for, or what the player looks like. Overall, the nature of fantasy football does not demand that the user have a good memory, but in situations in which the user must remember something, the app reduces the need to recall with a search system that emphasizes recognition.

## 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

The NFL Fantasy Football App offers a limited number of features that make the user experience enjoyable and efficient for both expert level users and beginners. For example, when drafting players at the beginning of the season, expert users can analyze the player pool and set their pre-draft order. During the draft, they can assign players to their queue to be auto-drafted during the next round. For beginners, the draft can be intimidating, so the app allows users to complete the draft based on pre-determined rankings by experts. That is, beginners who do not know how to draft can auto-draft their entire team without needing to go through the more complicated process of expert users. 

Another feature that increases the user's efficiency is the optimization function. This function allows the user to auto-generate the best projected roster for a given week without needing to manually switch players in and out of the lineup. Players who want more control over their team are still able to change their roster manually and do not have to optimize their roster based on the app's projected scores. 

![FF flexibility](http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/fantasy/general/fan_images_league-types.png)

I believe the app can improve when it comes to flexibility and efficiency of use. Expert users should be able to auto-add potential free agents without needing to monitor their availability status throughout the season. For instance, if I want Mark Ingram on my team, I should be able to tap a function that notifies me of his availability and automatically adds him to my team when possible. Another possible improvement that would make the fantasy football experience easier for beginners is to develop an aggregate rating measure for each player. This single rating will take into account multiple other predictors of success and can serve as a simple guide for beginners who are trying to decide who to put on their team. This experience contrasts the current experience in which users need to tediously analyze players using many statistics such as play time, style of offense, and past performance.

Severity Rating: 2

## 8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

Using a white, turquoise, and gray color palette, the NFL Fantasy Football App provides the user with a aesthetically acceptable interface. Headings and sections are rectangular with smooth corners and are all in readable font. Colors do not clash, and even small text is readable. Player profiles feature light logo backgrounds that do not interfere with the player pictures and add flavor to the interface. 

The design is also quite minimalist, given the amount of information a user needs to be successful in fantasy football. The roster interface provides a picture, name, and total points of each player with details about the team they play for and their position. The top of the interface shows the user's league record and any win or loss streak he/she might be on. There are options to trade, manage waivers, or add players. The information given on the roster interface is necessary and informative. Some elements such as the player picture may be unnecessary, but without them, the interface lacks spirit. 

![FF prevention](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1UC1ltYuF_ddHJvOLedElpBsmvqXlI8B2)

The player profile is also minimalist in design. Each player has five summary statistics at the top with information about the latest matchup below. Clicking the "stats" tab allows the user to see more in-depth data about that player and his past performances. There are no unnecessary graphics or text. 

![FF prevention](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HNOTmuHg26RqYUyOqtrJHFlLYew_KXb3)

Overall, the NFL Fantasy Football App is aesthetically acceptable and not too cluttered with information. There may be some room to improve upon the app in this regard such as changing to a richer color palette or reducing the amount of numbers on certain interfaces, but the current state of the app's aesthetics does not undermine the user experience to any noticeable extent. 

Severity Rating: 1

## 9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

The NFL Fantasy Football App does a poor job of notifying, diagnosing, and recovering from system errors. The most common error I ran into when testing was a connection error. Lacking internet service, the app prompts the user with a "Something went wrong" message. This tells the user that there is an error but does not describe what the error is or how to fix it. This hurts the user experience because this vague message leaves the user uninformed and unable to fix the issue. 

![FF prevention](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1J8h8P4CnwU6nymX5eGZJsCSJ8Pslb-tO)

I was unable to trigger other error processing notifications during my testing, but based on what I observed, I believe the app has much room for improvement in this area. For instance, the app should identify what the problem is and suggest concrete steps to fix it. If it is a connection or loading error, it is better that the user knows, so that he/she can try to fix it. 

Severity Rating: 2

## 10: Help and Documentation

The NFL Fantasy Football App excels when it comes to help and documentation. The app provides basic documents like the terms and conditions and the privacy policy. Notably, there is a search system in the settings tab that allows users to ask questions and look up key words. For instance, if a user wants to learn how to add and drop players, he/she can turn to this search system for advice on how to do this (see below). In addition, the home page interface provides articles that help users with fantasy football strategies and predictions. Every week, for example, NFL.com publishes recommendations on which players should start and which players should stay in reserves. Overall, the NFL Fantasy Football App provides an abundance of resources for users who have questions about the functionality of the app itself and for users who want to effectively compete in their fantasy football league.

![FF prevention](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1sudZ_R67X6RePhH2YxcTkqTKD9aucrJx)

One weak point of the mobile app is that it is does not provide introductory materials for completely new users. Users who have no experience with fantasy football will find themselves lost as they are thrown into an interface built for users who already know how fantasy football works. The app could drastically improve its user experience and marketing if it offered a tutorial system or fantasy beginner's guide. 

Severity Rating: 2
